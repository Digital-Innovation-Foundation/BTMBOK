    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand these statements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define the external environment of organizations.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identify contemporary external forces pressuring organizations.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identify different types of organizational structures and their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Explain how organizations organize to meet external market threats and opportunities.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identify the fit between organizational cultures and the external environment.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identify environmental trends, demands, and opportunities facing organizations.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Organizations and industries are again at a crossroads when confronting new and challenging external environmental&#xD;
    demands. Exceptional companies such as Amazon, in the opening case, Apple, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet Inc. exemplify&#xD;
    evolving business models that combine strategic innovation, technological prowess, and organizational cultural agility&#xD;
    that not only meet external environmental demands, but also shape them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many businesses with traditional business models, however, have failed or are not succeeding strategically,&#xD;
    operationally, and organizationally by not realizing and/or adapting to changing external environments. Such firms that&#xD;
    were once successful but did not anticipate and then adapt to such changes include Blockbuster, Toys R Us, Borders, Sun&#xD;
    Microsystems, Motorola, Digital Equipment Corporation, Polaroid, and Kodak, to name only a few. A sample of&#xD;
    contemporary external environmental trends and forces that currently challenge organizations’ survival and&#xD;
    effectiveness includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI): Extensions of AI help automate a firm’s value chain, thus&#xD;
    speeding up and increasing efficient operations and service to customers—as Amazon exemplifies. A current survey showed&#xD;
    that 59% of organizations are collecting information to develop AI strategies, while others are moving forward in&#xD;
    piloting and/or adopting AI solutions to compete faster and at less cost.1 However, there are also risks that accompany&#xD;
    firms that incorporate new digital and online technologies without adequate security measures. For example, some newer&#xD;
    online technologies can expose operational systems to cyberattacks and large-scale manipulation. Hacking is now both an&#xD;
    illegal and ongoing “profession” for those who are able to paralyze organizations from accessing their data unless they&#xD;
    pay a ransom. While hacking is not new, it is more widespread and lethal, to the point of even threatening national&#xD;
    security. Emerging evidence from the U.S. presidential election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton suggests that&#xD;
    international hackers affected online U.S. election processes. Still, the future of most businesses is using some type&#xD;
    of digital and AI technologies.&lt;br />&#xD;
    The advent of blockchain technologies that are interrupting new industry practices. Blockchain is not a single&#xD;
    technology; it is “an architecture that allows disparate users to make transactions and then creates an unchangeable&#xD;
    record of those transactions.” It is “a public electronic ledger—similar to a relational database—that can be openly&#xD;
    shared among disparate users and that creates an unchangeable record of their transactions, each one time-stamped and&#xD;
    linked to the previous one.”2 These technological inventions will continue to affect almost every business process from&#xD;
    procurement to legal management. The banking industry is already using it. It increases speed, security, and accuracy&#xD;
    of transactions.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Sharing-economy cultural and economic value-added business models that use information technologies to gain competitive&#xD;
    advantage. Companies such as Airbnb and Uber have ushered in new business models that have already disrupted real&#xD;
    estate, hotel, taxi, and other industries. Taking out the middle layer of management in transactions to increase&#xD;
    efficiencies and customer satisfaction while cutting costs through the use of information and social media technologies&#xD;
    will continue. This trend has already had both positive and disruptive effects on companies. Many customers are likely&#xD;
    benefitted; businesses with outdated and ineffective business models have either failed or struggle to adapt.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Shifts in learning and learning credentials. Identifying, recruiting, and retaining talent is crucial to organizations.&#xD;
    An evolving crisis for the current generation—future talent—is the continued rise in higher educational institutions’&#xD;
    tuitions, student debt, and the changing nature of jobs. With the advent of online resources, prospective students’&#xD;
    inability to pay creates both a crisis and opportunity for traditional higher educational institutions. While&#xD;
    bachelor’s degrees remain a requirement for many companies hiring needed higher-level talent, online resources such as&#xD;
    Khan Academy, Udacity, and Coursera are gaining recognition and legitimacy toward providing financially challenged&#xD;
    students opportunities for entry-level jobs. While many higher-skilled students and professionals may not presently be&#xD;
    included in this trend, companies seeking to pay lower wages while offering flexible working conditions are attracting&#xD;
    students.3 Again, how higher educational private, not-for-profit, and even for-profit educational institutions adapt,&#xD;
    innovate, and manage their external environments is yet to be seen.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Ethics, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and sustainability. Corruption, lying, and fraud have been and continue&#xD;
    to be part of the landscape of governments and public- and private-sector corporations. However, public awareness&#xD;
    through social and online media has awakened consumers and corporations to the impending dangers and drawbacks of&#xD;
    illegal and unethical activities of certain large corporations. And external environmental problems, created in part by&#xD;
    humans, such as pollution and climate change pressure companies to be responsible for their share of the costs&#xD;
    associated with these problems.&lt;br />&#xD;
    This small sample of powerful external forces illustrates the continuing pressure companies encounter to innovate in&#xD;
    their industries. Basic theories, concepts, and principles are presented in this chapter to help explain elements of&#xD;
    external environments and how organizations and corporations can organize and are organizing to survive and thrive in&#xD;
    the 21st century.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Jeff Bezos of Amazon&lt;br />&#xD;
    Amazon’s market value was estimated at $1 trillion USD dollars in 2018. The company was recognized as the most&#xD;
    innovative company in Fast Company’s 2017 list, accounting for 44 percent of all U.S. e-commerce that&#xD;
    year—approximately 4 percent of the U.S.’s total retail sales. Amazon market value is greater than the sum of the&#xD;
    market capitalizations of Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, JCPenney, Sears, and Macy’s. Jeff Bezos,&#xD;
    founder and leader, has creatively accomplished what most large companies fail at: meshing size, scale, and external&#xD;
    opportunities with agility. Sales figures reached $100 billion in 2015 while the stock price climbed over 300% in the&#xD;
    past five years. The company plans on creating over 50,000 new jobs starting in 2018. Bezos has blended his strategy of&#xD;
    virtually reaching unlimited numbers of online customers while maintaining land-based distribution centers using&#xD;
    Prime’s $99-per-year—$119 in 2018—membership. Stephenie Landry, an Amazon’s vice president, stated that Prime has&#xD;
    reached 49 cities in seven countries. Over 100 million people in 2018 subscribe to the Prime service. She noted that&#xD;
    the business has only to answer two questions from customers: “Do you have what I want, and can you get it to me when I&#xD;
    need it?” The answer seems to be yes, especially with Bezos’s strategy of having high-tech robots already working side&#xD;
    by side with human employees—resembling a “factory of the future.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Bezos’s digital commerce strategy has led the firm to become the leader of retail commerce. Amazon’s digital strategy&#xD;
    uses Prime memberships that are supplied and supported by land-based distribution centers; Prime takes in reaching&#xD;
    about 60% of the total dollar value of all merchandise sold on the site. That accounts for 60 million customers in the&#xD;
    United States who use Prime and who spend $2,500 on Amazon annually. A study of 3,000 independent businesses, half of&#xD;
    whom were retailers, listed competition from Amazon as their primary concern. Industry after industry is being&#xD;
    disrupted, some replaced, by Bezos’s strategy. He has said, “Everybody wants fast delivery. Low prices. I’m serious&#xD;
    about this. Our job is to provide a great customer experience, and that is something that is universally desired all&#xD;
    over the world”.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Still, Amazon faces such challenges as high shipping cost (over $11 billion annually), pressures on employees&#xD;
    (especially those working in warehouses that have been criticized for poor working conditions), shipping contractors&#xD;
    who go on strike demanding higher wages and reduced workloads, and the possibilities of more governmental regulation&#xD;
    (especially with regard to adding drones as a delivery method), as well as pressures to pay more taxes. Bezos has&#xD;
    countered these arguments by adding more full-time jobs in different cities, promising to improve working conditions,&#xD;
    supporting public spaces for the public, and most importantly, contributing to the U.S. economy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
