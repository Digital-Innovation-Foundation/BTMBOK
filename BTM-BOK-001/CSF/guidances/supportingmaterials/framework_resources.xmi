    These mappings are intended to demonstrate the relationship between existing NIST publications and the Cybersecurity&#xD;
    Framework. These preliminary mappings are intended to evolve and progress over time as new publications are created and&#xD;
    existing publications are updated. Initially, each publication has been mapped only once to the category considered&#xD;
    most applicable. Certain NIST publications that have broad applicability across multiple categories of a function have&#xD;
    been included within the General Mappings section.&#xD;

    This is a listing of publicly available Framework resources. Resources include, but are not limited to: approaches,&#xD;
    methodologies, implementation guides, mappings to the Framework, case studies, educational materials, Internet resource&#xD;

    Criteria for Inclusion&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If your resource is: publicly available on the Internet, accurate and comprehensive for a given dimension of the&#xD;
    Framework, and freely available for others to use (we welcome free resources from for-profit entities), it meets the&#xD;
    basic criteria for inclusion in the Framework Web site. Pay-for resources associated with non-profit entities also meet&#xD;
    the basic criteria for inclusion in the Web site. If your resource qualifies and you would like it listed at the&#xD;
    Framework Industry Resources Web page, send a description of your resource to &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;mailto:cyberframework@nist.gov&quot;>cyberframework@nist.gov&lt;/a>.&#xD;
