    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Unified Architecture Method (UAM), the&amp;nbsp;Business Process Model defines all of the business&#xD;
    activities&amp;nbsp;of the system under study. &lt;em>Activities&lt;/em> may represent complete business lines, complete&#xD;
    businesses (at the highest level of abstraction) or smaller portions of business activities within a business.&#xD;
    Activities may also represent business processes, which are composed of sub-processes, tasks, events&amp;nbsp;and decision&#xD;
    points. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/whitepapers/uam_bpmn_intro_tutorial_426154F6.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_gYTbgN2MEdyVUKFKTmaZUA&quot;>Whitepaper: BPMN - an Introductory Tutorial&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>Activities&lt;/em>, in the UAM context,&amp;nbsp;are used to partition and understand the structure&#xD;
    of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;system under study, from a process perspective, resulting in&amp;nbsp;manageable chunks, in much the same&#xD;
    way that an enterprise is typically partitioned into inter-dependent business lines and business units. However, the&#xD;
    role and purpose of different parts of an organization are not always clear to other parts of it, which results in&#xD;
    less-than-optimal interactions when executing a business process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the UAM, &lt;em>activities&lt;/em> start at the abstract level of the BPMN concept. Activities are abstracted&amp;nbsp;and&#xD;
    related to other activities or sub-activities (and possibly roles and resources), and they also explicitly define&#xD;
    &lt;i>interfaces&lt;/i>,&amp;nbsp;and the set of processes and tasks (services or responsibilities) they provide.&amp;nbsp;This use&#xD;
    of an abstraction of &lt;em>business activity&lt;/em> often goes hand-in-hand with using business models at different levels&#xD;
    of abstraction as in the UAM&amp;nbsp;(see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/concepts/uam_complex_modelling_A4EC9E37.html&quot; guid=&quot;_PjkWoObaEdyjVoHXO3Mbfg&quot;>Concept:&#xD;
    Complex IT Architectures&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>&lt;u>Note&lt;/u>:&lt;/strong> Since UAM may be used at any level within the enterprise, the level of detail to be&#xD;
        included in this model is a judgment call of the architect, based upon:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN-LEFT: 2em&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The objective of the architecture effort&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The size of the enterprise or (business line)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Time and resource constraints&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Layering the Business Process Model is a convenient way to deal with complexity. Start with a top layer of activities&#xD;
    that are abstractions of all the 'activities' of the system under study, with the next layer of detail showing more&#xD;
    details of these&amp;nbsp;activities. More&amp;nbsp;layers can be used as well if the size and complexity warrants it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Business Activities as&amp;nbsp;Components&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this &quot;Internet&amp;nbsp;Era&quot; and &quot;Internet Speed&quot;, businesses need to be more dynamic; meaning that&amp;nbsp;they need to&#xD;
    change, update, add or modify their business activities and processes much more quickly than in the past. Defining&#xD;
    structure and independent business activities as components provides the independence and flexibility required. At the&#xD;
    design and implementation level, this may equate to a Service Oriented Architecture, but not necessarily. The objective&#xD;
    is to have independent activities (namely, sub-processes and tasks) that are easily reconfigured, or even dynamically&#xD;
    re-configured as dictated by business desires and business drivers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business activities have well-defined boundaries with predefined interfaces supporting interactions between business&#xD;
    activities. These interfaces (possibly formalized service-level agreements) become the hinges that support the&#xD;
    organization and also permit easier reconfiguration because&amp;nbsp;activities are decoupled from each other. Dependencies&#xD;
    are defined in terms of interfaces and responsibilities, not on&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>how&lt;/i> these responsibilities are carried out.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This approach very much equates to similar concepts in the past (but applied here to enterprise and&#xD;
    system&amp;nbsp;modeling), such as modular programming, structured programming, and structured design just to name a few.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using business events and messaging&amp;nbsp;to abstract and define&amp;nbsp;interactions between activities can reduce direct&#xD;
    dependencies even further. Because business events make time and space transparent, business activities can interact&#xD;
    indirectly (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_business_event_82E69349.html&quot; guid=&quot;_sWMqgE13EeOcVJX_gvTjyg&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Business Event&lt;/a>) through messages.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If encapsulation is not considered important or required for a given business activity (due to its level of abstraction&#xD;
    or for other reasons), then the business activity boundary may be defined as notional&amp;nbsp;and will not exist during&#xD;
    business operation. You can indicate this in the model by saying that the business activity (which is a kind of UML&#xD;
    component) is not &lt;em>directly&lt;/em> instantiate-able—it comes into being only through the instantiation of its parts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Business&amp;nbsp;Processes&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business services&amp;nbsp;are provided to customers/users through or by&amp;nbsp;business activities or processes. We&#xD;
    &lt;em>are&lt;/em> concerned with encapsulation here, and can indicate that business services have more than notional&#xD;
    boundaries by making&amp;nbsp;them directly instantiate-able. This&amp;nbsp;defines the business service provided by the&#xD;
    process (i.e. a collection of activities) such that, in operation, the boundary will be somehow made real and visible&#xD;
    to customers/users.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business activities explicitly define the responsibilities&amp;nbsp;that they can be asked to perform. This specification&#xD;
    of behavior is essential because it allows the decoupling mentioned in the previous section. A business activity that&#xD;
    does not define its services is without meaning. There is no way that another business activity can know what services&#xD;
    it provides, other than inferring them from its name. At the business level these services may not be very explicit or&#xD;
    clear, but they need to be made clear at the Logical and Technical levels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The services provided&amp;nbsp;define the means of interaction with the business activities/process and are essentially&#xD;
    specified as operations of the interface(s) to the service. These interfaces are collections of related activities and&#xD;
    as such describe the sub-process that the business activities play in providing the service. At this business level&#xD;
    however, these interfaces may not be clearly understood and therefore not clearly defined.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The example below shows the set of&amp;nbsp;business activities (i.e. process) of&amp;nbsp;the research lab within the&#xD;
    ThuNorTech fictitious enterprise used in the UAM example architecture (See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/customcategories/uam_examples_view_8972F3FE.html&quot; guid=&quot;_LVNzcLvYEeKBoecYDPr3dQ&quot;>UAM&#xD;
    Examples&lt;/a>). This process provides the &quot;Perform Lab Study&quot; service to customers. &amp;nbsp;The diagram shows how the&#xD;
    defined activities interact to perform&amp;nbsp;a lab study. From this diagram, it becomes apparent that the&#xD;
    responsibilities can be reassigned by allocating an interface to another business activity—to re-direct the workflow to&#xD;
    modify or augment the process. This reallocation of responsibility would conceptually have no effect on other business&#xD;
    activities that make use of them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 1 - A simple Business Process Model with collaborating activities&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This&amp;nbsp;UAM process description, part of the Business Process Model, in no way defines the solution approach. SOA,&#xD;
    Client-Server or any other approach may be used to implement these activities and processes—decisions that are made at&#xD;
    the Logical and Technical levels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Business Activities Contain Actors and Resources&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business activity is an abstraction of a collection of people, hardware, and software and other resources that work&#xD;
    together to perform the responsibilities of the business process. They are an &quot;abstraction&quot; because we describe models&#xD;
    of the processes in terms of activities, roles and resources. A business activity contains actors, and may contain&#xD;
    business roles and business entities. A business &lt;em>task&lt;/em> is an &lt;em>activity&lt;/em> that cannot be decomposed any&#xD;
    further in the business modeling effort. A business entity is a piece of information created or manipulated by business&#xD;
    activities or business systems.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We &lt;strong>&lt;em>do not,&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> during our business modeling effort, decide that:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A role is bound to a particular activity, this is defined at the Logical level;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A human (or humans)&amp;nbsp;is bound to a particular business actor. Actors are defined but not their relationship to&#xD;
        humans, this is defined at the Logical level;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The activity and associated actor or role will be fulfilled by software (and associated computational hardware);&#xD;
        again, this is defined at the Logical level.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Activities may capture a very complex system, with associated Actors, and possibly roles and resources. In some cases&#xD;
    this high-level of abstraction is required and desired in order to hide complexity. These business activities can&#xD;
    eventually be mapped to human resources, or to specific hardware or software systems. This abstraction helps us focus&#xD;
    on the actors and interfaces of the business activities&amp;nbsp;and determine the &lt;i>necessary&lt;/i> responsibilities&#xD;
    without having to consider the (usually imperfect) real situation of a specific person or system, which is left to the&#xD;
    Logical level of&amp;nbsp;analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that at the business level, computational notions are absent, including the bindings of business activities to&#xD;
    systems, and the binding of associated actors to humans.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;A Business has Many Business Use Cases&quot; name=&quot;A Business has Many Business Use Cases&quot;>A Business Has Many&#xD;
    Business&amp;nbsp;Activities&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Instances of several different business activities, as well as several instances of a single business activity,&#xD;
    normally execute in parallel. There might be an almost unlimited number of paths an activity instance can follow. These&#xD;
    different paths represent the choices open to the activity instance in the workflow description. Depending on specific&#xD;
    events or facts, a activity instance can proceed along one of several possible paths, directed, for example by:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Input from an actor;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A&amp;nbsp;business rule;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A business event.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In modeling business activities, you can assume that activity instances can be active concurrently without conflict. At&#xD;
    this stage of business development, you should focus on &lt;b>what&lt;/b> the business should do.&amp;nbsp;These potential&#xD;
    conflicts are solved later, when modeling the&amp;nbsp;Logical or even Technical level, at which stage you try to&#xD;
    understand &lt;b>how&lt;/b> things should work in the business. Or you might solve these problems during the implementation,&#xD;
    for example,&amp;nbsp;by increasing the number of employees who can perform the critical task.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Are Business Activities Always Related to Business Actors?&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Every business activity does not necessarily have a relationship to or from a business actor. Actors interact with the&#xD;
    system to get services --- but services are provided through a process, a collection of activities. Some of these&#xD;
    activities therefore may be automated or otherwise do not have associated actors. The level of the modeling effort also&#xD;
    has an impact upon the need for actors, for example&amp;nbsp;in a high-level enterprise architecture most of&#xD;
    the&amp;nbsp;activities should have associated actors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Business Processes &amp;amp; Activities vs. Business Functions&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business activity are not be simply&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>allocated&lt;/em> to a business processes. Often processes are the&#xD;
    customer-facing and require the collaboration of a number of business process and activities in order to fulfill the&#xD;
    service request of the customer. Business activities (and even processes) collaborate, similar to Figure 1,&amp;nbsp;to&#xD;
    perform business processes. The diagram in Figure 2 below clarifies the relationship between business services&#xD;
    (processes) provided to customers versus how the enterprise is organized along functional lines — along generic&#xD;
    business functions such as financial management or customer relations.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Business Processes/Services vs. Business Functions&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/Business-Perspective-Function-vs-Process.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 2 -&amp;nbsp;Business processes vs. business functions&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This clarifies the difference between a business process and a business function. This distinction is important when&#xD;
    defining architectures and specifically the process models. A business function provides functionality that is useful&#xD;
    for one or more business processes — it is the vertical view of the business (e.g. Customer Relations or Financial&#xD;
    Services). A business process on the other hand is a horizontal view of the business that at a high-level equate to&#xD;
    business services offered to customers (e.g. Order Processing or Travel Booking). This distinction is not always clear,&#xD;
    especially at lower levels within an enterprise, but when modeling at the Business level it is important. These&#xD;
    concepts are illustrated in the Figure 2, which is well understood by Business Analysis’s and definitely needs to be&#xD;
    understood by IT architects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Structuring the Business Process Model&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are three main reasons for structuring the Business Process Model:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make the business activities easier to understand;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reuse parts of workflows that are shared among many business processes;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make the Business Process Model easier to maintain.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Layering may be done&amp;nbsp;in any perspective and aspect (see: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/concepts/uam_levels_and_views_499BC4B8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_W4UEAMqpEdy25fQyv59CjQ&quot;>Concept:&#xD;
    Architecture Perspectives and Viewpoints&lt;/a>). In addition to the partitioning approach where multiple activities are&#xD;
    formed into processes, one may also layer activities.&amp;nbsp;High-level layers provide general viewpoints of the&#xD;
    enterprise or the &quot;system&quot; at a high conceptual level, with lower layers adding detail. This fits nicely with the&#xD;
    audience for these different viewpoints and layers. For example, a company's executive management, as well as its&#xD;
    process owners, are interested in their company's business models — management work with&amp;nbsp;overall views and&#xD;
    objectives, whereas the process owners and leaders need a more detailed picture of how their process should be&#xD;
    performed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the enterprise (i.e. the &quot;system&quot; being architected) is large and complex, or if differences between the executives'&#xD;
    and the process owners' views of the organization are great,&amp;nbsp;this can be dealt with by developing two&amp;nbsp;(or&#xD;
    more yet related)&amp;nbsp;layers. One model, for the executives, would contain a set of high-level business activities&#xD;
    that show the intent and purpose of the organization. The other model, for the process owners, would contain a detailed&#xD;
    set of activities that help clarify how the organization needs to function internally. For each high-level business&#xD;
    activity, you could define one, or several, detailed business activities representing the same thing within the&#xD;
    organization. For example, you could start with the primary business actor, detail the results and services he or she&#xD;
    is interested in,&amp;nbsp;then develop a separate business activity&amp;nbsp;for each detailed area.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you want to engineer your organization one business activity at a time, you can apply this technique incrementally.&#xD;
    First make a high-level activities model of the entire business and then &quot;drill-down&quot; into one of the activities of&#xD;
    interest to provide a more detailed model for the process owner. There is a one-to-one relationship between a&#xD;
    high-level business activities and its set of more detailed business activities — with the detail &lt;em>encapsulated&lt;/em>&#xD;
    within the activity. The figure below illustrates this concept. The &quot;Sales &amp;amp; Marketing&quot; activity (Contained within&#xD;
    a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) high-level activity) is drilled-down to expose more details.&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    What is an activity at the business level?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the business level, an activity represents a clustering of work that delivers a meaningful output.&amp;nbsp;Often an&#xD;
    activity at this level encapsulates a sub-process that may be re-used &lt;em>or&lt;/em> encapsulates further detail.&amp;nbsp;At&#xD;
    the Business level, activities can be structured to hide complexity and to layer a business process for ease of&#xD;
    understanding.&amp;nbsp;There is usually functional cohesiveness involved in choosing activities at this level.&amp;nbsp;An&#xD;
    activity may or may not be constrained by automation assumptions. Generally the automation decisions are left to the&#xD;
    architects and are defined and represented at the Logical level.&amp;nbsp;The choice of activities at this level and their&#xD;
    sequence must be representative of the business vision.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    What is a task at the business level?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A task is the most granular level of activity representation, a cohesive (atomic) unit of work.&amp;nbsp;Tasks can be&#xD;
    further broken down into steps but this is done in the task description and not in the diagram.&amp;nbsp;A task is a type&#xD;
    of activity.&amp;nbsp;There is no need to distinguish between the types of activities or tasks at the business level unless&#xD;
    the business wishes to impose a constraint on the architecture (e.g., they want a particular unit of work to be&#xD;
    automated or not).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    How do business rules fit in?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business rules, at this level, should represent only the rules that apply to the business regardless of where they&#xD;
    would be positioned in the activity sequence.&amp;nbsp; These are the ‘true’ rules that constrain business practices due to&#xD;
    policy or legal limitations.&amp;nbsp;It is important to isolate these at this level.&amp;nbsp;They are best not associated&#xD;
    with specific activities.&amp;nbsp;This will encourage the statement of these rules in a process and technology independent&#xD;
    way. References:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brsolutions.com/publications.php#books&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Ronald Ross&#xD;
    books&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    How does the present organization fit in?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It need not, should not.&amp;nbsp;It is best to associate activities with business functions as opposed to existing&#xD;
    organizational structures.&amp;nbsp;The organization may change considerably during the lifetime of the architecture&#xD;
    documents so to keep the models stable; handle organizational structure separately.&amp;nbsp;Also, the redesign of the&#xD;
    organizational structure is an activity that would be owned by the architecture team. The architecture models, the&#xD;
    roles model in particular, provide valuable input into that effort which should be carried out with HR representatives&#xD;
    from the business.&amp;nbsp;Ideally, HR representatives (or appropriate managers) are involved in various aspects of the&#xD;
    architecture so that they can acquire the knowledge they need first hand.&amp;nbsp;On the other hand, interaction with&#xD;
    outside agencies or customers is important to have clearly represented in the business process models.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Stay Organized&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is very easy for the modeling effort to slip away from any kind of overall order.&amp;nbsp;Constant tweaking at the&#xD;
    lower levels can lead to inconsistencies in the overall consistency of the models.&amp;nbsp;Avoid too many layers.&amp;nbsp;Two&#xD;
    to three layers are ideal.&amp;nbsp;More than three is very difficult for users of the models to understand and&#xD;
    manage.&amp;nbsp;Always keep the top level diagrams and the context diagram up to date and available to all&#xD;
    modelers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    BPMN usage&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is very important to go light on the notation at the Business&amp;nbsp;level.&amp;nbsp; Ease of comprehension is more&#xD;
    important than expressing all of the details.&amp;nbsp; The&amp;nbsp;Business Perspective Language defines a simple set of&#xD;
    modeling elements&amp;nbsp;to be used.&amp;nbsp;Portray what is important to the vision and at a level of detail that can&#xD;
    provide context to business constraints / requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    How do business requirements fit in?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business process model provides the ideal context for a set of business requirements.&amp;nbsp;Since the business&#xD;
    process model reflects the business vision, the specific business needs statements can fit within the description of&#xD;
    the activities.&amp;nbsp;There are also supporting activities that may not have a place in the models that need to be&#xD;
    addressed, as well as non-functional requirements that need to be placed within a separate context.&amp;nbsp;Keep in mind&#xD;
    that the business rules must be documented separately at this level. If business functions have been shown in the&#xD;
    business process model then these can provide a good context for the business rules.&amp;nbsp;The requirements at this&#xD;
    level are statements of a business needs and do not necessarily describe the functionality of a system as the&#xD;
    automation decisions are not made until the logical architecture is being modeled.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business activities&amp;nbsp;are aligned with the business strategy, as described by concrete business goals.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Activities&amp;nbsp;conform to the business they describe.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All activities&amp;nbsp;are found. Taken together, activities&amp;nbsp;perform all tasks within the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Every activity within the business should be included in at least one process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        There should be a balance between the number of&amp;nbsp;activities&amp;nbsp;and the size of the&amp;nbsp;activities: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Few activities make the model easier to understand.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Many activities may make the model difficult to understand.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Large activities may be complex and difficult to understand.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Small activities are often easy to understand. However, make sure that they describe a complete workflow&#xD;
                that produces something of value for a customer.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each activity must be unique. If the workflow is the same as or similar to another activity or process, it will be&#xD;
        difficult to keep them synchronized later. Consider merging them into a single activity.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The description of the Business Process Model should give a good, comprehensive picture of the organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Examples&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Airport&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An airline provides services to passengers. Because an airline is a very large and complex business to model, it makes&#xD;
    sense to divide it into a number of independent business activities/processes. Each business activity can then be&#xD;
    modeled independently as a business in its own right. Shown below is the &quot;Check-in&quot; business activity, but there are&#xD;
    many other activities within an airline company.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
