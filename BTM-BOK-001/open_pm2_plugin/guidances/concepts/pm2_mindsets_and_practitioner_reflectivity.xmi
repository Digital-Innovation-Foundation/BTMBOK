    Project managers and project team should&amp;nbsp;regularily ask themselves the following questions:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Do we know what we are doing?&lt;/strong> Tip: Develop a clear and shared project vision. Manage the project
        using a holistic approach and optimise the whole project, not just parts of it. Follow a process but stay Agile and
        try to regularly remind yourself why you are doing something.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Do we know why we are doing it?&lt;/strong> Does anyone really care? Tip: Make sure your project matters.
        Understand its goals, value and impact, and how it relates to the organisational strategy. Define upfront what
        project success is and deliver maximum value and real benefits, not just outputs.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Are the right people involved?&lt;/strong> Tip: People make projects work. The primary criterion for involving
        people and assigning project roles should be to serve the needs and objectives of the project, and not politics,
        friendship, functional hierarchy, proximity or convenience.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Do we know who is doing what?&lt;/strong> Tip: Know what you should be doing, and make sure others know what
        they should be doing. Is it clear to everyone? Clearly define and understand roles, responsibilities and
        accountabilities.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Deliver at any cost or risk?&lt;/strong> Tip: Show respect for people’s work and organisational funds and
        avoid high-risk behaviour and tactics. Always keep in mind that it is not just about the end result - how you get
        there also matters. Manage your projects based on positive values and principles.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Is this important?&lt;/strong> Tip: Everything is NOT equally important. Identify, and agree on, the project’s
        Critical Success Criteria (CSC), Minimum Viable Product and Critical Success Factors (CSFs), and allocate effort
        and attention both tactically and strategically for the benefit of both the project and project management goals.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Is this a task for “them” or for “us”?&lt;/strong> Tip: Make sure that client and provider groups work as one
        team towards a common goal. Real teamwork really works; so foster clear, effective and frequent communication.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Should I be involved?&lt;/strong> Tip: Contribute from any position. Be proud of the skills, value and
        positive attitude you bring to the project. Help everyone who needs to be involved get involved. Promote and
        facilitate the contributions of all stakeholders.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Have we improved?&lt;/strong> Tip: Commit to ongoing self- and organisational improvement by gathering and
        sharing knowledge. Project teams should reflect on how they can become more effective and adjust their behaviour
        accordingly.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Is there life after the project?&lt;/strong> Tip: The product (or service) lifecycle has just begun! Make sure
        you have contributed to its success.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></mainDescription>
