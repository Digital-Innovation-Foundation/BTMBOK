    <sectionDescription>Based upon input from business leaders and other management the business priorities are identified that apply to the&#xD;
&quot;system&quot; under study. Technical priorities are also identified, such as migration to an &quot;xyz&quot; environment.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Based upon the deconflicted business and technical priorities, and&amp;nbsp;the IT project (or system) requirements,&amp;nbsp;a set&#xD;
of IT architecture project objectives are defined.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    IT architectures should not be defined unless there are clear objectives defined for using the subsequent artifacts.&#xD;
    Often the scope of the &quot;system&quot; is large and therefore these objectives are used to focus the effort and reduce the&#xD;
    time, money and resources needed to produce a useful result. Some example objectives are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Refine the application architecture;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Refine or define the application or service middleware infrastructure;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Server consolidation;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understanding the network and rationalizing its structure and services.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are just a few of many types of objectives that may be defined to help focus the IT architecture effort.&#xD;
