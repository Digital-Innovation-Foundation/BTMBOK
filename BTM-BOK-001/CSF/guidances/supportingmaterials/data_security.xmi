  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Data security is the process of maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization’s data&#xD;
    in a manner consistent with the organization’s risk strategy. Preventing unauthorized access, data corruption, and&#xD;
    denial of service attacks are all important tenets of data security and an essential aspect of IT for organizations of&#xD;
    every size and type. Consistent, reliable, and secure access to database records, system files, user files, and&#xD;
    customer data is necessary to prevent data from becoming vulnerable to attack. Before an incident begins, companies&#xD;
    must have a security architecture and response plan in place. Once an incident occurs, they must be able to detect the&#xD;
    event and respond accordingly. After the incident, the company must be able to effectively and efficiently recover.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In accordance with this methodology, the Data Security program at the NCCoE has produced guidance for both data&#xD;
    integrity and data confidentiality. Each will consist of a series of publications that work together to identify,&#xD;
    protect, detect, respond to and recover from critical events.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
