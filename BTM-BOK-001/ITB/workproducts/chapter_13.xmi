    Using Technology to Manage Information&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    How has information technology transformed business and managerial decision-making?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why are computer networks an important part of today’s information technology systems?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What types of systems make up a typical company’s management information system?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How can technology management and planning help companies optimize their information technology systems?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the best ways to protect computers and the information they contain?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the leading trends in information technology?&lt;br />&#xD;
    This chapter focuses on the role of information technology (IT) in business, examining the details of MIS organization,&#xD;
    as well as the challenges companies encounter in an increasingly technological world. As John Daly learned, harnessing&#xD;
    the power of information technology gives a company a significant competitive advantage.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    John Daly, Daly Investment Management, LLC&lt;br />&#xD;
    When meeting with a Daly Investment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dalyinvestment.com&quot;>https://www.dalyinvestment.com&lt;/a>)&#xD;
    financial consultant, most likely you are thinking about money, your money. Whether you seek a short-term investment or&#xD;
    a retirement nest egg, money will be your focus. You probably will not be thinking about the technological&#xD;
    infrastructure required to transmit information throughout a multibillion dollar, nationwide institution such as TD&#xD;
    Ameritrade—information that often is private and financial in nature. Luckily for you, however, the company is led by&#xD;
    financial advisor John Daly, who works with TD Ameritrade to support his company’s technology needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After successful careers at Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley, Daly knew when he started his own firm he would need IT&#xD;
    support so that he could ensure the security of the funds he managed for his customers while focusing on the financial&#xD;
    aspects of managing their finances. In addition to providing a financial trading platform for individual investors, TD&#xD;
    Ameritrade has a robust set of software as a service cloud-based tools that allow Daly to focus on his core&#xD;
    competencies rather than having to hire, train, and maintain a complex set of IT resources that his clients can trust.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Given the size of the assets it manages, TD Ameritrade’s management information system (MIS) is necessarily large. TD&#xD;
    Ameritrade’s open architecture environment enables financial advisors like John Daly to select the technology they want&#xD;
    to use. The lesson is that Daly could act as an entrepreneur and start his own firm while providing information&#xD;
    technology with the scale that customers expect and providing the personal service that is often missing when dealing&#xD;
    with larger organizations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
