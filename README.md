Business Technology Management (BTM) Body of Knowledge (BOK)
============================================================

**Summary**

BTM BOK is a guide to the unified professions of IS/IT management.

https://www.btm-forum.org/standards/bok

It is delivered in a single Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) Method Library and Wiki, and reuses primarily 100+ CC BY-SA, EPL 1.0, & EUPL 1.2 references, with some under freer licenses such as CC-BY, Apache, and MIT.

**Practices**

BTM BOK doesn't reinvent the wheel, but instead intends to connect readily existing industry certifications and standards. We focus on specifications covering the whole range of Digital Transformation roles and tasks.
