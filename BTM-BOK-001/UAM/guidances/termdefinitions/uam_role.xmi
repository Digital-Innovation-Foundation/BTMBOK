  <mainDescription>A role is equated to or defined by the behavior (and by extension its responsibilities) that it interacts with in the&#xD;
system—the activities that it interacts with. A role is in essence the “interface” to the activities with which it&#xD;
interacts. A role can be assumed (aggregated) by any kind of actor, either human or a system. An actor may be aggregate&#xD;
multiple roles, and an actor can be associated with&amp;nbsp;multiple physical people (or systems). Roles also include security&#xD;
concepts and constructs. An employee of the enterprise is typically multiple actors with the system and therefore has many&#xD;
different roles. Also see the definition of &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

Role&lt;/a>, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/termdefinitions/uam_func-role_668447D2.html&quot;&#xD;

&lt;strong>&lt;em>Note&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>: This distinction between Functional and Contextual Roles is made clear in: &lt;a&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Roles are typically realized by an individual, or a set of individuals, working together as a team. An employee of the&#xD;
    enterprise typically fulfills many different roles. Note that &lt;b>roles are not individuals nor are they necessarily&#xD;
    equivalent to job titles;&lt;/b> instead, they describe how individuals should behave in the enterprise and the&#xD;
    responsibilities of an individual. Individual members of the organization will wear different hats, or perform many&#xD;
    different Roles. The mapping from individual (user)&amp;nbsp;to Role is performed by managers within the&#xD;
    enterprise&amp;nbsp;when defining and staffing the positions (and their responsibilities) within their organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to avoid confusion between &lt;em>functional roles&lt;/em> and &lt;em>contextual roles&lt;/em> the following conventions&#xD;
    have been adopted: Functional and organizational roles will always be expressed as nouns (e.g. &lt;em>TigerTeam&lt;/em>);&#xD;
    Contextual roles will always be expressed as verbs (e.g. &lt;em>Collaborating&lt;/em>). This rule reflects the core&#xD;
    differences between the role types: functional (and organizational) roles really do refer to persons, places, or&#xD;
    things; contextual roles are actions performed by a subject on an object.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Roles are used as the fundamental method for defining access permissions to protected objects (i.e. RBAC, see: &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Role-Based Access Control&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;on&#xD;
    Wikipedia).&#xD;
