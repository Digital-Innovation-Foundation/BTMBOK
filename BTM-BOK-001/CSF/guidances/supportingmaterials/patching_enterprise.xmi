    Current Status&lt;br />&#xD;
    This project is currently in the build phase. We have selected several technology collaborators who have signed a&#xD;
    Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA, see an example) with NIST.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Download the final Critical Cybersecurity Hygiene: Patching the Enterprise&amp;nbsp; project description for more&#xD;
    information on the project or read the two-page fact sheet for an overview.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Summary&lt;br />&#xD;
    There are a few root causes for many data breaches, malware infections, and other security incidents. Implementing a&#xD;
    few relatively simple security hygiene practices can address those root causes—preventing many incidents from occurring&#xD;
    and lowering the potential impact of incidents that still occur. In other words, security hygiene practices make it&#xD;
    harder for attackers to succeed and reduce the damage they can cause.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Unfortunately, security hygiene is easier said than done. IT professionals have known for decades that patching&#xD;
    software—operating systems and applications—eliminates vulnerabilities. Despite widespread recognition that patching is&#xD;
    effective, it's also&amp;nbsp; resource-intensive. And the act of patching itself can reduce system and service&#xD;
    availability. However, delaying patching deployments gives attackers a larger window of opportunity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Critical Cybersecurity Hygiene: Patching the Enterprise Project will examine how commercial and open source tools&#xD;
    can aid with the most challenging aspects of patching general IT systems. We are using commercial and open source tools&#xD;
    to aid with the most challenging aspects, including system characterization and prioritization, patch testing, and&#xD;
    patch implementation tracking and verification. We will include actionable, prescriptive guidance on establishing&#xD;
    policies and processes for the entire patching lifecycle to include defining roles and responsibilities for all&#xD;
    affected personnel and establishing a playbook containing mitigation actions for destructive malware outbreaks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This project will result in a NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide, a publicly available description of the practical&#xD;
    steps needed to implement a cybersecurity reference design that addresses this challenge.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Collaborating Vendors&lt;br />&#xD;
    Organizations participating in this project submitted their capabilities in response to an open call in the Federal&#xD;
    Register for all sources of relevant security capabilities from academia and industry (vendors and integrators). The&#xD;
    following respondents with relevant capabilities or product components (identified as “Technology&#xD;
    Partners/Collaborators” herein) signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to collaborate with NIST in a&#xD;
    consortium to build this example solution.&#xD;
