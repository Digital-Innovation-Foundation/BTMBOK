    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typically this is done by detailing business scenarios. Within UAM &quot;use-cases&quot; are not recommended nor used since they&#xD;
    are greatly misunderstood and often abused. Just define scenarios, with the help of business experts, refine them and&#xD;
    combine them as required. Start with a wide general view of the system and added detail as the models are developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Not that only external actors are defined at this point. The analysis (and architectural decisions) required to specify&#xD;
    &quot;roles&quot; are left until the Logical level of analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Optionally, during the definition of business processes various business entities, business rules and business events&#xD;
    may be identified. This should not be onerous ... simply identify the main elements that are important to the business.&#xD;
    Greater definition of these elements is again left until the Logical level analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes simple process definitions are not enough to capture the activities with the system. In this case&amp;nbsp;a&#xD;
    number of&amp;nbsp;interacting process may be defined. Within BPMN these are defines as &quot;conversations&quot; ... but UAM&#xD;
    simplifies this type of complex interaction to be a set of interactive processes. We are defining IT architectures,&#xD;
    therefore the level of detail (and therefore the number of design-level decisions) is reduced to a manageable level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ensure that the interactions with the &quot;system&quot; are complete and that they are organized in such a way as to make the&#xD;
    understandable and manageable.&#xD;

    The&amp;nbsp;Business Process Model is complete only when it describes everything the business performs (within the given&#xD;
    scope). Ensure that&amp;nbsp;the Business Process Model exhibits the characteristic properties of a good model diagram,&#xD;
    see: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_business_process_model_D051CAFD.html&quot;&#xD;

    Evaluate each workflow by&amp;nbsp;doing a walkthrough. This&amp;nbsp;is where&amp;nbsp;the person responsible for the business&#xD;
    process (business expert) leads one or two members of the team through the business workflow. It is recommended to use&#xD;
    a specific scenario ... or a few, to ensure coverage.&#xD;
