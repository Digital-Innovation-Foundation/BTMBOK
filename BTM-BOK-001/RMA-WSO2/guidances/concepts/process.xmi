    Process defines the steps an organization should take to achieve its goals. A process is connected with the people&#xD;
    involved in its execution, as well as the technology being implemented to optimize their productivity. This document&#xD;
    mainly focuses on defining a meta-process.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    While many software development processes have been introduced, we can put them all into two buckets:&#xD;
    &lt;strong>waterfall&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>agile&lt;/strong>. To date, there have been many attempts to become truly agile,&#xD;
    but it has not been an easy task due to several technical and cultural constraints. As a result, many enterprises have&#xD;
    had to fall back to waterfall-agile or fast waterfall processes. However, now we are living in an era with of DevOps&#xD;
    improvements and extremely flexible deployment infrastructures, which create continuous processes that allow teams to&#xD;
    operate in a truly agile manner.&#xD;
