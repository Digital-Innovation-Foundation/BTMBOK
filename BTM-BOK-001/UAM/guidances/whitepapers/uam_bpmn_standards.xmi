&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI) has developed&amp;nbsp;the standard Business Process Model and Notation&#xD;
    (BPMN). The primary goal of BPMN is to provide a notation that is readily understandable by all business users, from&#xD;
    the business analysts that create the initial drafts of the processes, to the technical developers responsible for&#xD;
    implementing the technology that will perform those processes, and finally, to the business people who will manage and&#xD;
    monitor those processes. Thus, BPMN creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the business process design and&#xD;
    process implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another goal, but no less important, is to ensure that XML languages designed for the execution of business processes,&#xD;
    such as BPEL4WS (Business Process Execution Language for Web Services), can be visualized with a business-oriented&#xD;
    notation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This specification defines the notation and semantics of a Business Process Diagram (BPD) and represents the&#xD;
    amalgamation of best practices within the business modelling community. The intent of BPMN is to standardize a business&#xD;
    process modelling notation in the face of many different modelling notations and viewpoints. In doing so, BPMN will&#xD;
    provide a simple means of communicating process information to other business users, process implementers, customers,&#xD;
    and suppliers.&#xD;
