    NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework Revisions&lt;br />&#xD;
    REVISIONS&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NICE Framework is a living document that is updated periodically based on change requests to the NICE Program&#xD;
    Office. NICE will consider recommendations (change requests) for expansion, update/correction, withdrawal, or&#xD;
    integration of NICE Framework components using the process described below. These recommendations allow the Framework&#xD;
    to continue to serve as a fundamental reference for describing and sharing information about cybersecurity work,&#xD;
    workforce, training, and education, as well as the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) needed to complete&#xD;
    cybersecurity tasks and responsibilities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Drawing on public and private sector input, NICE works to achieve consensus on the change requests balancing the need&#xD;
    for periodic change and the need for a stable framework. This approach will ensure that the NICE Framework continues to&#xD;
    be a reference resource to support a workforce capable of meeting an organization’s cybersecurity needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Section 1.1 below describes the process a change requests will undergo. Section 1.2 below lists the type of information&#xD;
    that should accompany the change requests.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    CHANGE REQUEST PROCESS&lt;br />&#xD;
    The following text describes the general change request process, illustrated in Figure 1, below:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A NICE Framework user who sees a potential change to the NICE Framework content may submit a change request&#xD;
    electronically at any time by email to: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:niceframework@nist.gov&quot;>niceframework@nist.gov&lt;/a>. (See&#xD;
    Section 1.2 for guidance on the content to include with a change request.)&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NICE Program Office will acknowledge receipt of the change request.&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NICE Program Office will perform a preliminary review of the change request to confirm that the request is clear&#xD;
    and contains relevant, supporting content. Incomplete change requests will be returned to the submitter with&#xD;
    feedback.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Complete change requests will be evaluated for their applicability to the NICE Framework. Some change requests will be&#xD;
    relevant to the overall ecosystem of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development, but not directly&#xD;
    relevant to the content of the NICE Framework.&amp;nbsp; Such change requests will be noted in the NICE Framework Denied&#xD;
    Request Log with an explanation for the denial. The Denied Request Log supports transparency and helps inform users&#xD;
    about changes that have already been considered or identifies when a change requests is duplicative of existing&#xD;
    material in the NICE Framework. Change requests deemed complete and applicable will move to step 5.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
    If the change request is an administrative adjustment, such as to correct a minor error, the change will occur&#xD;
    immediately and will be recorded in the NICE Framework Change Log shown below.&amp;nbsp; The change will be made to the&#xD;
    appropriate tables in the NICE Framework and the reference materials posted on the NICE Framework website.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Applicable, non-administrative change requests will be reviewed by the NICE Framework Change Panel, a panel of cyber&#xD;
    skills subject matter experts. The panel may ask NICE to seek more public development for some change requests using a&#xD;
    repository for the NICE Framework on NIST’s GitHub site. Approved changes will be noted in the NICE Framework Change&#xD;
    Log and those changes will be made to the appropriate tables in the NICE Framework and the reference materials posted&#xD;
    on the NICE Framework website. The Denied Change Log will be updated when a change request is denied.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    GUIDANCE FOR CHANGE REQUEST CONTENT&lt;br />&#xD;
    The change request provides an opportunity to indicate the rationale for the request and to provide additional&#xD;
    information regarding its impact and timeliness.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Please submit the required information below for each type of change.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Add Task – Recommended task description, rationale for addition and applicable Work Role(s) where the task should be&#xD;
    listed&lt;br />&#xD;
    Change Task – Current Task ID, Updated task description, rationale for change and applicable Work Roles(s) where the&#xD;
    task should be listed&lt;br />&#xD;
    Delete Task – Rationale for deletion&lt;br />&#xD;
    Add KSA – Recommended KSA description and identification of Work Role(s) in which the KSA should be listed&lt;br />&#xD;
    Change KSA – Current KSA ID, recommended KSA description and rationale for change&lt;br />&#xD;
    Delete KSA – KSA ID and rationale for deletion&lt;br />&#xD;
    Add Work Role – Recommended description and recommended Specialty Area in which Work Role fits&lt;br />&#xD;
    Change Work Role – Work Role ID, rationale for change and a listing of KSA(s) and Task(s) affected.&amp;nbsp; If&#xD;
    applicable, rationale for moving the changed Work Role to a different Specialty Area&lt;br />&#xD;
    Delete Work Role – Work Role ID and rationale for deletion&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NICE Program Office will maintain an ongoing record both of changes accepted and implemented (the Change Log) and&#xD;
    of change requests that were not implemented (the Denied Change Log). Users are encouraged to review these logs before&#xD;
    submitting their requests.&#xD;
