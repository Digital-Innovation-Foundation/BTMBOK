    Raising the bar to increase adoption of trusted digital identity solutions&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST’s approach to digital identity focuses on achieving an environment in which individuals and organizations utilize&#xD;
    secure, efficient, easy-to-use, and interoperable identity solutions to access online services in a manner that&#xD;
    promotes confidence, privacy, choice, and innovation.&lt;br />&#xD;
    The drive toward this vision focuses on two high-level goals of government and commercial adoption through the&#xD;
    advancement of foundational activities in standards, technology, and measurement science. To achieve these, NIST&#xD;
    employs four primary tactics: partnerships, publications, market intelligence, and communications.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Partnerships&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST relies heavily on partnerships across government, commercial, and non-profit sectors to develop, deploy, and adopt&#xD;
    trusted digital identity technology, guidance, and policy, establishing an identity marketplace of solutions leveraged&#xD;
    by both public and private sectors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Pilots program&lt;br />&#xD;
    Catalyzing the marketplace, filling gaps, and improving the future&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The pilots program seeds the marketplace with trusted digital identity solutions to accelerate the growth of&#xD;
    privacy-enhancing, secure, interoperable, and convenient solutions. The pilots develop and deploy technology, models,&#xD;
    and frameworks that wouldn’t otherwise exist in the marketplace. The pilots program’s cross-market use cases have&#xD;
    catalyzed and scaled solutions for protecting children’s online privacy, improving veterans’ access to benefits, and&#xD;
    securing patients and providers’ access to electronic health records.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identity Ecosystem Framework (IDEF)&lt;br />&#xD;
    Laying the foundation for a vibrant identity ecosystem&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Identity Ecosystem Framework (IDEF) is a set of core documents laying the groundwork for better digital identity&#xD;
    transactions. Developed by the private-sector led Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (IDESG), version 1 of the IDEF&#xD;
    represents three core documents that describe the Identity Ecosystem and the requirements, best practices, and approved&#xD;
    standards needed to be considered in compliance with it. The IDEF serves as the foundation for the IDEF Registry, which&#xD;
    enables businesses and organizations to identify trusted digital identity service providers and more easily adopt&#xD;
    trusted identity solutions. For more information on the IDESG, the IDEF, and the IDEF Registry, visit the IDESG’s&#xD;
    website.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Publications&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST publishes formal documents, whitepapers, and informal communications to share progress, seek feedback via public&#xD;
    comment periods, and recap workshops and other events.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    Market intelligence&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST identifies, collects, and analyzes metrics to gain greater insight into the development and adoption of trusted&#xD;
    digital identity solutions. This work aids NIST in measuring the market shift toward these solutions and honing efforts&#xD;
    moving forward so that NIST most effectively uses program resources. NIST is using market intelligence to keep up with&#xD;
    the pulse of the market and to hone efforts in transitioning from addressing broad challenges to specific gaps and&#xD;
    impediments in the market.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Communications&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST leverages external communications to inform the public about its work and engage a variety of audiences to&#xD;
    collaborate on projects. NIST also coordinates communications internally to align efforts and maximize the impact of&#xD;
    NIST’s investment in cybersecurity initiatives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
