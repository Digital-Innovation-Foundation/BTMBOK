# Open Access BTM Texbook and Courseware: Call to Action

**Proposal**

Teaching faculty and students in higher education require access to a new form of textbook to introduce managers to digital leadership, with different scope of learning at undergrad and grad levels.

We invite the academic and practitioner community to work on a new free and open-access BTM courseware, all published under CC BY to ensure widest adoption and customization:

- Book (12 chapters)
- Cases (3 per chapter, 2 small and 1 large)
- Appendices (overviews: technologies, BTM, careers)
- Readings (links to resources)
- Presentations (powerpoints)
- Tutorials (videos)
- Exams (samples)

This suite of free and customizable assets will be published as complements to the BTMBOK, which has a different audience, being primarily an open index of BTM competencies, not a pedagogical tool, but valuable free contents to be reused-refactored into courseware.

We do not aim to replicate existing excellent open-access courseware, such as the one developed by David Bourgeois and his team, adopted by 70+ universities worldwide.

Instead, we must explore how to improve the learning process and how best to help practitioners. 

**Philosophy**

The overall pedagogical philosophy could follow a more "pragmatic" approach to introducing digital leadership to non-IS/IT managers, or specialists of other business disciplines.

Existing textbooks and intro courses tend to present Information Systems primarily as "theory and general knowledge", with practice elements covered in cases, mostly aligned to serve "illustrations of theory" as opposed to "building from practice".

This 2022 AMCIS paper proposes to adopt a "Digital-as-Practice" perspective, building upon and integrating other "as-practice" perspectives, e.g., Strategy, Project, Leadership, etc.

**Outline**

One key issue is the textbook learning sequence, which needs to be linear and made of building blocks, and present BTM from a pragmatic perspective while referencing theory extensively.

Various knowledge elements can help learners "grow into their role" as managers concerned with IS/IT, who may wish to become digital leaders.

Roles should be generic and simple, so as to stick to the reality of learners, who can envision being observers of business and IT, end-users, etc. up to strategy makers and entrepreneurs.
