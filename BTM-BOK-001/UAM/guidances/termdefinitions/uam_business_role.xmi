  <mainDescription>A role is equated or defined by the behavior (and by extension its responsibilities) that it interacts with in the system -&#xD;
the activities that it interacts with. A role is in essence the &quot;interface&quot; to the activities with which it interacts.&#xD;
Business Roles are high-level conceptualizations of the Roles with the system; further analysis is required to fully&#xD;
understand and define required roles. A role can be assumed (aggregated) by any kind of actor, either human or a system. An&#xD;
actor may be aggregate multiple roles, and an actor can be associated with multiple physical people (or systems). Roles&#xD;
also include security concepts and constructs. An employee of the enterprise is typically multiple actors with the system&#xD;
and therefore has many different roles. Also see the definition of &lt;em>&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
