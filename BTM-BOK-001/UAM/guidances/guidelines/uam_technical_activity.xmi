    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Unified Architecture Method (UAM) uses the concepts and terminology as defined by the OMG's Business Process&#xD;
    Modeling Notation definition to describe business activities, processes and tasks. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/whitepapers/uam_bpmn_standards_84B155CD.html&quot; guid=&quot;_JqlCMOAEEdynr9jlfK-aMA&quot;>Whitepaper:&#xD;
    BPMN - the standard&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/whitepapers/uam_bpmn_intro_tutorial_426154F6.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_gYTbgN2MEdyVUKFKTmaZUA&quot;>Whitepaper: BPMN - an Introductory Tutorial&lt;/a>. BPMN defines business activities as&#xD;
    work to be performed as part of a business process. Activities in turn represent either a Task (an atomic activity) or&#xD;
    a Sub-Process (a compound activity).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The processes of a business are therefore defined as a number of different activities, each of which represents a&#xD;
    specific task or sub-process in the business. An activity defines what happens within the business when an event start&#xD;
    up the activity; it describes a sequence of actions (Tasks and Sub-Processes) that produces a valuable result for a&#xD;
    particular actor. At the technical level the focus is on making technical decisions, even if the&amp;nbsp;complete workflow&#xD;
    (activities, processes, sub-processes and tasks) are not all defined. Decisions regarding technical solutions, solution&#xD;
    patterns, and other technical details are documented in Architectural Decisions, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/tasks/uam_define_architectural_decision_C5FEB5B4.html&quot; guid=&quot;_1rxFAMUVEdyVgeP6fyp1bg&quot;>Task: Define&#xD;
    an Architectural Decision&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending upon the size and scope of the enterprise, and the objectives of the architecture effort, it may be desirable&#xD;
    to define the full details of the workflows, as illustrated below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Technical (detailed) activity model - expense claim&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/Technical-Perspective_TPM-Expense-Claim.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 1 - Task details&amp;nbsp;for &quot;expense reimbursement&quot;.&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Technical activities specify the interactions between the subject system and its actors/roles, &lt;em>and the effect that&#xD;
    they have on the business&lt;/em>â€”the performance of an activity may change the state of the business (and thus may change&#xD;
    the way the business responds to future events or interactions), and the activities must specify and capture these&#xD;
    state changes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A services view of the system is also possible, since what the business directly and explicitly provides to its&#xD;
    environment are &lt;em>services&lt;/em>, and the interaction between the actor and the business, as described in the&#xD;
    (high-level) activity, will take place through the invocation of one or more of those services.&amp;nbsp;The collected set&#xD;
    of activities constitutes all the possible ways of using the business and how they are supported,&amp;nbsp;and all the&#xD;
    possible actions (events) and actors that the business deals with. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_technical_process_model_A664F0AD.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_qYVn8O6hEdy8F4k6ANL48Q&quot;>Guideline: Technical Process Model&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Name&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The name of the technical activity should express what happens when an instance of the activity is performed. The form&#xD;
    of the name should therefore be active, typically described by the gerund form of the verb (Checking-in) or a verb and&#xD;
    a noun together.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The names can either describe the tasks in the activity, for instance &lt;em>placing an order&lt;/em>. Although an activity&#xD;
    describes what happens within the business, it is often most natural (and recommended) &amp;nbsp;to name the activity from&#xD;
    its primary actor's point of view.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Goals&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The goal of a logical activity should be specified from at least two perspectives:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For the actors the process interacts with, specify the value those actors expect from the business (expected&#xD;
        result).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        From the perspective of the organization performing the process, define what the objectives are of having this&#xD;
        process in place and what you hope to achieve by performing it (business goals).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Performance Goals&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some common metrics categories are:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Time&lt;/strong> - an approximation of the time it should take to execute the workflow, or part of the&#xD;
        workflow.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Cost&lt;/strong> - an approximation of the cost of executing the workflow, or part of the workflow.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Quality&lt;/strong> - for example, &quot;no more than 2% of products should be defective when they come off the&#xD;
        production line&quot;.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A major challenge is to understand what scenarios (activity instances) are relevant to measure. Criteria to use are&#xD;
    frequency of the scenario, or business relevance of the scenario. If you can determine that a particular part of the&#xD;
    workflow has importance, you may save yourself some effort by only measuring the cost or time of that subflow.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Workflow - Structure&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most activities may be thought of as several sub-processes, which together yield the total workflow. Sometimes several&#xD;
    activities in the system have common sub-processes or tasks, or the same sub-process (or task)&amp;nbsp;appears in&#xD;
    different parts of one activity. If this common behavior has any substantial volume, it should be performed by the same&#xD;
    actors/roles. This is the key value added for the technical process model, deciding upon the structure and&#xD;
    relationships between activities, tasks and process, which are defined as the details of each activity and process are&#xD;
    defined.&amp;nbsp;See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_diagrams_in_technical_pers_877C1261.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_sQx18OrgEdytvcf-4U2D3Q&quot;>Guideline: Technical Perspective Views&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Characteristics of a Good Technical Activity&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Its name and brief description are clear and easy to understand, even to people outside the modeling team.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Each activity is complete from an outside (actor's) perspective. For example, the activity &lt;em>Expense&#xD;
            Reimbursement&lt;/em> in a company starts when an employee files a travel claim. The &lt;em>Expense&#xD;
            Reimbursement&lt;/em> activity is not complete unless it includes a notification about the decision from the&#xD;
            company to the employee and (if appropriate) a compensatory payment.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Each activity normally is involved with at least one actor. Activities are initiated by actors and business&#xD;
            events, interact with actors to perform the tasks, and deliver results.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It is possible, but unusual, for a supporting activity not to interact with an actor. This is true if an&#xD;
            activity is initiated by an internal event and does not have to interact with an actor to perform its tasks.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It is substantial. Remember, a concrete activity must be easy to read. Therefore, an abstract activity should&#xD;
            not be too small. If an abstract activity is not substantial, it should be eliminated and its tasks should be&#xD;
            described in the affected concrete activity.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It contains logically related tasks.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It exists for a specific reason. An abstract activity should contain any of three kinds of tasks: those that&#xD;
            are common across several activities; those that are optional; or those that are important enough that you want&#xD;
            to emphasize them in the model.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;Characteristics of a Good Process Description&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It must be clear and easy to understand, even for people outside the modeling team.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It describes the workflow, not just the purpose of the activity.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It describes only those tasks that are inside the business.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It describes all possible tasks in the activity. For example, what happens if a condition is met, as well as&#xD;
            what happens if it is not.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It does not mention actors who do not communicate with it. If it did mention other actors, it would make the&#xD;
            description difficult to understand and maintain.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It describes only those tasks that belong to it, not what is going on in other activities that work parallel to&#xD;
            it.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It does not mention other activities with which it does not have relationships. If the activity requires that&#xD;
            some results exist in the business before it can start, this should be described as a precondition. The&#xD;
            precondition should not have any references to the activity in which the result was created.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It indicates if the order of any tasks described for the activity is not fixed.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It is structured so that it is easy to read and understand.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            The description clearly describes the start and end of the workflow.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Each extend-relationship is described clearly so that it is obvious how and when to insert the business&#xD;
            activity.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
