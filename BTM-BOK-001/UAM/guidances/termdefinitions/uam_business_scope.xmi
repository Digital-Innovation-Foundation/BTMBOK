  <mainDescription>The architectural process, as with project definitions, must start by defining the &lt;em>scope&lt;/em> and &lt;em>context&lt;/em> of&#xD;
the architecture. Everything else flows from this—for example, enterprises generally have more than one &quot;business line&quot;.&#xD;
The architecture for each business line will be quite different and should therefore be examined and define through&#xD;
separate activities. Each enterprise also needs an &quot;enterprise&quot; architecture that will integrate the business line&#xD;
architectures as required. The scope and context of each architecture effort needs to be clear before plunging into the&#xD;
definition of the architecture. &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The &quot;Business Scope&quot;, or simply &quot;Scope&quot;, is a very simple description of the architecture in terms of “entities”,&#xD;
    “activities”, “locations” and “roles” that sets the &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;>context&lt;/i> for the IT&#xD;
    architecture including the scope of the effort and the definition of important concepts and terms. No modeling is&#xD;
    involved. The primary stakeholders are business managers and other business people.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
