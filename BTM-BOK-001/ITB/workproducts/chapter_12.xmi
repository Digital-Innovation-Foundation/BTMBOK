    Distributing and Promoting Products and Services&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What is the nature and function of distribution (place)?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What is wholesaling, and what are the types of wholesalers?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the different kinds of retail operations?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How can supply-chain management increase efficiency and customer satisfaction?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What is promotion, and what are the key elements of a promotional mix?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How are advertising media selected?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What is personal selling?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the goals of a sales promotion, and what are several types of sales promotion?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How does public relations fit into the promotional mix?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What is social media, and how has it changed promotion?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What is e-commerce, and how does it affect promotion?&lt;br />&#xD;
    This chapter continues to reveal the role of marketing, starting with a discussion of the distribution system and&#xD;
    concluding with a look at traditional and nontraditional marketing channels. It explores how organizations use a&#xD;
    distribution system to enhance the value of a product and examines the methods used to move products to locations where&#xD;
    consumers wish to buy them. Distribution is also known as “place” in terms of the 5Ps, key components of the marketing&#xD;
    mix. It is important to have an understanding of the members of a distribution system and to explore the role of&#xD;
    wholesalers and retailers in delivering products to customers. In addition to understanding how the supply chain works&#xD;
    to increase efficiency and customer satisfaction, marketers must also develop tactics for promotion, the last element&#xD;
    of the marketing mix. Promotion is comprised of six parts, which include traditional advertising, sales promotion,&#xD;
    personal selling, public relations, social media, and e-commerce.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Steve Piehl, Harley-Davidson&lt;br />&#xD;
    A road not taken is the next adventure waiting. Live to ride; ride to live. These are just a few of the creeds that&#xD;
    Harley riders live by. Whether it’s the vision of the open road, the shine of chrome, or the smell of dust mixed with&#xD;
    exhaust, people are drawn to Harley-Davidson motorcycles. How often do you see someone with “Honda” tattooed on their&#xD;
    chest? Harleys are the stuff that dreams and identities are made of.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Steve Piehl, who was the director of communications at Harley-Davidson before retiring in 2015, helped shape people’s&#xD;
    dreams for more than 25 years. He used traditional marketing channels such as print, radio, and television advertising;&#xD;
    however, Harley also, understandably, approaches marketing nontraditionally.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus of Harley marketing is not selling a product, but selling an experience. Piehl explains, “The difference of&#xD;
    that experience is what has given us success. We don’t categorize what that experience is. We leave it up to people to&#xD;
    make it their own.” For some, a Harley is a ticket to freedom; for others, it is a knockout ride to work. Harley’s&#xD;
    promotion of accessories supports this idea. As Piehl says, “No two Harleys on the street are the same.” A part of the&#xD;
    purchasing process is a meeting with a “chrome consultant” who can help with customizing and accessorizing your bike.&#xD;
    In this way, the bike becomes part of one’s identity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Part of Harley’s focus on experience is its support of motorcycle riding as a sport. On its website and at the&#xD;
    dealerships, it provides tips and classes for rider improvement. Through the Harley Owners Group (HOG), a membership&#xD;
    group of Harley owners, Harley promotes events and rallies where owners can get together and ride. They form what Piehl&#xD;
    calls “brothers and sisters of the road.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is with this focus on the “sport” that Harley creates its most powerful marketing tool: the motorcycle mentor.&#xD;
    Through the nature of the Harley community, previous owners coach new owners on buying a more advanced bike, taking an&#xD;
    overnight trip, or packing for long-distance rides. Piehl says, “We would be doing a disservice if we said we reach&#xD;
    everyone with our product announcements. But when we put it out, it works its way through the customer base. Our owners&#xD;
    sell our products. They encourage people to get more involved in the sport.” And tools such as chat rooms on the Harley&#xD;
    website or magazines such as HOGtales and Motorcycle Enthusiast facilitate that sharing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    So how does Harley-Davidson measure its marketing success? It participates in Customer Satisfaction Index studies to&#xD;
    measure satisfaction for people who purchase new motorcycles. But it is the statistic that over 90 percent of Harley&#xD;
    owners will repurchase a Harley that carries the weight. “When we get a customer, we can pretty much keep them. Our&#xD;
    marketing is to get new customers and to keep existing [customers] happy,” Piehl says.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is just another part of Harley’s creed: We believe life is what you make it, and we make it one heck of a ride.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
