    Forms of Business Ownership&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What are the advantages and disadvantages of the sole proprietorship form of business organization?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the advantages of operating as a partnership, and what downside risks should partners consider?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How does the corporate structure provide advantages and disadvantages to a company, and what are the major types of&#xD;
    corporations?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What other options for business organization does a company have in addition to sole proprietorships, partnerships, and&#xD;
    corporations?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What makes franchising an appropriate form of organization for some types of business, and why does it continue to grow&#xD;
    in importance?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why are mergers and acquisitions important to a company’s overall growth?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What current trends will affect the business organizations of the future?&lt;br />&#xD;
    This chapter discusses sole proprietorships, as well as several other forms of business ownership, including&#xD;
    partnerships and corporations, and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With a good idea and some cash in hand, you decide to start a business. But before you get going, you need to ask&#xD;
    yourself some questions that will help you decide what form of business organization will best suit your needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Would you prefer to go it alone as a sole proprietorship, or do you want others to share your burdens and challenges in&#xD;
    a partnership? Or would the limited liability protection of a corporation, or perhaps the flexibility of a limited&#xD;
    liability company (LLC), make more sense?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are other questions you need to consider too: Will you need financing? How easy will it be to obtain? Will you&#xD;
    attract employees? How will the business be taxed, and who will be liable for the company’s debts? If you choose to&#xD;
    share ownership with others, how much operating control would they want, and what costs would be associated with that?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As Table 4.1 illustrates, sole proprietorships are the most popular form of business ownership, accounting for 72&#xD;
    percent of all businesses, compared with 10 percent for partnerships and 18 percent for corporations. Because most sole&#xD;
    proprietorships and partnerships remain small, corporations generate approximately 81 percent of total business&#xD;
    revenues and 58 percent of total profits.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most start-up businesses select one of these major ownership forms. In the following pages, we will discover the&#xD;
    advantages and disadvantages of each form of business ownership and the factors that may make it necessary to change&#xD;
    from one form of organization to another as the needs of the business change. As a company expands from small to&#xD;
    midsize or larger, the form of business structure selected in the beginning may no longer be appropriate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Jessica MacLean&lt;br />&#xD;
    Sole Proprietor&lt;br />&#xD;
    In most any elementary school classroom, at least one child’s answer to the question, “What do you want to do with your&#xD;
    life?” will be, “A lawyer.” One of the most popular careers, lawyers are powerful figures in society, shaping our laws&#xD;
    and ensuring that we adhere to them. Their prominence and power have led to the stereotype of rich, career-driven&#xD;
    lawyers, often leaving no room in our minds for those who truly want to bring justice to the world. However, Jessica&#xD;
    MacLean, a lawyer focusing primarily on women’s rights, is quick to say that, as with many stereotypes, that is only&#xD;
    one side of the story. “I know because I lived that—I was on my way to being a successful corporate lawyer. But I&#xD;
    realized what I was doing and how different that was from why I’d started practicing. So I walked away from it all to&#xD;
    start my own practice.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Nervous about the prospect of private practice, she has chosen to operate as a sole proprietorship for now. Sole&#xD;
    proprietorships are easy to set up for people who want to work on their own, prefer direct control of the business, and&#xD;
    desire the flexibility to sell the business or close the doors at any time. “For me, it’s the best choice because I am&#xD;
    not responsible for or to anyone else. I can easily dissolve the business if I find it is not proceeding how I’d&#xD;
    planned. More positively, too, if it does succeed, I know that success is due to my hard work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Indeed MacLean’s law career was not always in corporate law. She turned her sights toward law after a gender and&#xD;
    communications professor at DePaul University suggested her argumentative style might be an asset in that profession.&#xD;
    “She said I needed to tone it down for class—that the other students seemed afraid to speak up—but then asked if I’d&#xD;
    ever considered being a lawyer.” MacLean, who had always been interested in issues of justice and legality surrounding&#xD;
    women, took her professor’s advice and made the leap into law.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While in law school, she clerked for the city of Chicago in their department of personnel’s sexual harassment office&#xD;
    and volunteered for the Cook County state’s attorney’s office in the domestic violence division. The cases she worked&#xD;
    on were emotionally trying. Despite the difficulty of the cases, she was drawn to them, compelled by the people she&#xD;
    helped and the change she was able to effect. After school, she continued in related practice, working first for the&#xD;
    Cook County state’s attorney’s office.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After several years with the state’s attorney’s office, she needed a change. It was then that MacLean decided to work&#xD;
    for a corporation, a form of business that you will learn about in this chapter. “Why did I switch to corporate law? I&#xD;
    think I was burnt out, to some extent. It’s so hard to work on those cases, day after day. I needed to see if I would&#xD;
    be better somewhere else.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Having enjoyed the rewards of working with the state’s attorney’s office and a corporation and being a sole proprietor,&#xD;
    in 2014 MacLean joined a limited liability partnership (LLP, a form of business that you will learn about in this&#xD;
    chapter) firm in Chicago. As her needs changed, the form and type of business organization she has worked for has&#xD;
    changed also.&#xD;
