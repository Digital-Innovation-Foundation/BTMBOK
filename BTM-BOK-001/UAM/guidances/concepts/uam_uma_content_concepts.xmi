  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Method Content is fundamentally described by defining Tasks described with Steps that have Work Products as input and&#xD;
    output and which are&amp;nbsp;performed by Roles.&amp;nbsp; Roles also define important responsibility relationships to work&#xD;
    products.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The fundamental Method Content abstractions are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Work Product&lt;/strong>, which includes &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/artifact_F635D25.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_x7cUM9nmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>artifact&lt;/a> , &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

        guid=&quot;_LNAAcB_iEdqAHrsQ7-jSbw&quot;>outcome&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Role&lt;/strong>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Task&lt;/strong>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    Work Product &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/workproduct-32.gif&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Work Product is an abstract concept which provides a generalization for the concrete work product types includes &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/artifact_F635D25.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x7cUM9nmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>artifact&lt;/a> , &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/deliverable_BFE1A5A9.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_yFbWoNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>deliverable&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/outcome_797E7695.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_LNAAcB_iEdqAHrsQ7-jSbw&quot;>outcome&lt;/a>. Work Product descriptions actually represents work product types, i.e. an&#xD;
    instance of Work Product is a description of a specific type of work product and not an individual work product&#xD;
    instance.&amp;nbsp; However, for simplicity reasons and because of low risk of misinterpretation we did not append the word&#xD;
    'type' to every element in UMA.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Work Product is an abstraction for descriptions of content elements that are used to define anything used, produced,&#xD;
    or modified by a task.&amp;nbsp; Roles use Work Products to perform Tasks and produce Work Products in the course of&#xD;
    performing Tasks.&amp;nbsp; Work Products are the responsibility of a single Role, making responsibility easy to identify&#xD;
    and understand, and promoting the idea that every piece of information produced in the method requires the appropriate&#xD;
    set of skills. Even though one Role might &quot;own&quot; a specific type of Work Products, other Roles can still use the Work&#xD;
    Products; perhaps even update them if the Role has been given permission to do so.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;

&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Main Work Products in UAM, and the approximate dependency relationships between them&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that Work Product is the term used to describe what other processes denote using terms such as Artifact, work&#xD;
    unit, and so on. In UMA, Deliverables are only considered to be the subsets of all Work Products that will end up being&#xD;
    delivered into the hands of the customers and users, usually as part of a formal or contractually agreed hand-over.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Role &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/role_medium.gif&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Role is a Method Content element that defines a set of related skills, competencies, and responsibilities. Roles are&#xD;
    used by Tasks to specify who performs them as well as define a set of Work Products they are responsible for.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;node&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Roles are typically realized by an individual, or a set of individuals, working together as a team. A project team&#xD;
    member typically fulfills many different roles. Note that &lt;b>Roles are not individuals nor are they necessarily&#xD;
    equivalent to job titles;&lt;/b> instead, they describe how individuals should behave in the project and the&#xD;
    responsibilities of an individual. Individual members of the organization will wear different hats, or perform&#xD;
    different Roles. The mapping from individual to Role is performed by the project manager when planning and staffing the&#xD;
    project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;node&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    While most roles are realized by people within the organization, people outside of the development organization play an&#xD;
    important role: for example, that of the stakeholder (i.e., business or technical expert/stakeholder) of the project or&#xD;
    product being developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Task &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;resources/task-group32.gif&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Task describes a unit of work. Every Task is performed by specific Roles. The granularity of a Task is generally a&#xD;
    few hours to a few days. It usually affects one or only a small number of Work Products. Tasks are not necessarily used&#xD;
    as&amp;nbsp;a basis for planning and tracking progress - they are often too fine-grained for that purpose; Activity&#xD;
    groupings of Tasks are often the better units for planning and tracking.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Task has a clear purpose, usually expressed in terms of creating or updating some Work Products, such as models,&#xD;
    classes, or&amp;nbsp;plans. Within a Task, each performing Role achieves a well defined goal. A Task provides complete&#xD;
    step-by-step explanations of doing all the work required to achieve this goal. This description is complete,&#xD;
    independent of when in a process lifecycle the work would actually be done. Therefore, it does not describe when you do&#xD;
    what work at what point of time, but describes all the work that gets done throughout the development lifecycle that&#xD;
    contributes to the achievement of the Tasks' goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When a Task is being applied in a Process, a reference object defined as Task Descriptor provides information, which&#xD;
    includes what elements of the Task will actually be performed at that point in time. This assumes that a Task will&#xD;
    usually be performed in the Process over and over again, but each time with a slightly different emphasis on different&#xD;
    steps or aspects of the Task description&amp;nbsp;as well as perhaps different or additional performing roles or different&#xD;
    input/output&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
