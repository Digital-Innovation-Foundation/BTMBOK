    The U.S. hospitality industry contributes nearly $600 billion to the U.S. economy and generates nearly $170 billion in&#xD;
    federal, state, and local taxes each year. Protecting this industry and its high volume of financial transactions and&#xD;
    related personally identifiable information from guest data is critical for its continued success. A 2016 survey by&#xD;
    Lodging Technology ranked payment and data security as the highest priority for technology spending by hotels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Securing Property Management Systems&lt;br />&#xD;
    Based on industry research and in collaboration with hospitality industry stakeholders, the NCCoE is proposing a&#xD;
    solution to better secure Property Management Systems (PMS) and its connections within a hotelâ€™s IT system that&#xD;
    implements layers of security, such as point-to-point encryption, data tokenization, multifactor authentication for&#xD;
    remote and partner access, network and user behavior analytics, and business-only usage restrictions. Learn more about&#xD;
    this project.&#xD;
