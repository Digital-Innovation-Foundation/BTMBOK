  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organizations understand the value mobile devices can add to their employees’ productivity by providing access to&#xD;
    business resources at any time. Not only has this reshaped how traditional in-office tasks are accomplished, but&#xD;
    organizations are devising entirely new ways to work. Yet mobile devices may be lost or stolen. A compromised mobile&#xD;
    device may allow remote access to sensitive on-premises organizational data, or any other data that the user has&#xD;
    entrusted to the device. The NCCoE mobile device security efforts are dedicated to solving businesses most pressing&#xD;
    mobile cybersecurity challenges.&#xD;
