    GENERAL PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE NIST CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK&lt;br />&#xD;
    &quot;Cybersecurity is just not a tech challenge, solved only in acquiring a technical solution. It is a business issue that&#xD;
    must be addressed comprehensively through people, processes, and technology. The NIST CSF provides a comprehensive and&#xD;
    programmatic approach to bridge the organization's businesses objectives with their security objectives, integrates&#xD;
    with other industry security control standards, and is flexible so that any organization can adapt to best suit their&#xD;
    needs.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;The use of the Cybersecurity Framework in our industry primarily is to have a common approach, to have a common&#xD;
    rational resource efficient approach to cybersecurity. It makes the entire ecosystem of financial services safer. It&#xD;
    can be applied to international expectations around cyber as well as state and national...&lt;br />&#xD;
    ….We found for our members, which include the largest global institutions as well as the smallest community banks that&#xD;
    the use of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was able to reduce their risk management burden about 43% for the largest&#xD;
    banks to 73% for the smallest institutions.&quot;&#xD;

    &quot;This Cybersecurity Framework really provides an extension to the cybersecurity solutions that people already have in&#xD;
    place. And what it really brings is a much higher level of transparency and trust to their customers, and stakeholders,&#xD;
    and interested parties throughout the organization.&quot;&#xD;

    “There are many security frameworks, but we found that the Cybersecurity Framework was well-aligned with our main&#xD;
    objective, which was to establish a common language for communicating cybersecurity risks across the Division,”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;There are many security frameworks, but we found that the Cybersecurity Framework was well-aligned with our main&#xD;
    objective, which was to establish a common language for communicating cybersecurity risks across the Division….The&#xD;
    Cybersecurity Framework enabled the BSD to identify security requirements as a set of target outcomes to be achieved,&#xD;
    while enabling departments to maintain internal processes and procedures regarding how to achieve those outcomes. As a&#xD;
    result…. each department has gained an understanding of BSD’s cybersecurity goals and how these may be attained in a&#xD;
    cost-effective manner over the span of the next few years. Using the Cybersecurity Framework helped foster information&#xD;
    sharing and good practices among departments.”&#xD;

    “We wanted to develop an action plan for cybersecurity. Based on the Cybersecurity Framework, the Baldrige&#xD;
    Cybersecurity Excellence Builder enables us to strategically choose where we are going to invest our time or resources.&#xD;
    It has helped us explain to people outside information security what we do and to hone our communication skills,&#xD;
    especially with the senior leaders of the organization so they can be advocates for us. It’s enabled deliberate&#xD;
    reflection on what is and isn’t working well, what are our gaps are, what we should be offering, and how that might&#xD;
    diverge from where we are today. This framework also has allowed us to open the door to a lot more people for this&#xD;
    conversation.”&#xD;

    PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE NIST CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK RELATED TO THE 16 U.S. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS&lt;br />&#xD;
    “There are many available standards our cybersecurity community may utilize to guide an agency in their quest for&#xD;
    furthering its cybersecurity program. With NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) designated as a tool federal agencies&#xD;
    should use, our local community, across the Nation, was incentivized to also follow the Framework. The NIST CSF has&#xD;
    served as a superb standard to enable all agencies to be on the same ‘measurement’ page. This allows agencies to be&#xD;
    measured and evaluated equally. The adoption of the NIST CSF for MS-ISAC’s Nationwide Cybersecurity Review (NCSR) was a&#xD;
    huge step in improving our state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) communities’ metric of year-to-year and&#xD;
    peer-to-peer comparisons on a national scale. As CISO to both Napa and Mono Counties (California), I have greatly&#xD;
    benefited by using NIST’s CSF in conjunction with MS-ISAC’s NCSR. The majority of California counties have also adopted&#xD;
    NIST’s CSF as the appropriate tool for our statewide standard.”&#xD;

    November 2018 - Framework Success Story&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;We have worked with a variety of industries, primarily in the private sector, that have had a thirst to find some&#xD;
    mechanism to improve how they identify and articulate risk.What the CSF does so well is create an ability to take very&#xD;
    complex risk concepts and produce a simplified outcome that can be effectively communicated to a broad group of&#xD;
    stakeholders. This provides a way to express to third parties -- that may have direct access to sensitive data as part&#xD;
    of a service they offer -- how risk has been evaluated by their business partners. In turn, that creates a more healthy&#xD;
    conversation between companies as to how best protect that data.&quot;&#xD;

    “Our postmarket guidance outlines a risk-based framework manufacturers should use to ensure they can quickly and&#xD;
    adequately respond to new cybersecurity threats once a device is in use. The FDA’s policy leverages the National&#xD;
    Institute for Standards and Technology’s Framework for Improving Cybersecurity of Critical Infrastructure. This&#xD;
    underscores the importance of adoption by medical device manufacturers of the Framework’s five core functions –&#xD;
    identify, protect, detect, respond and recover.”&#xD;

    PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE NIST CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK RELEVANT FOR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS OF OTHER&#xD;
    NATIONS&lt;br />&#xD;
    &quot;When the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was first introduced, it was introduced at fairly senior levels, to members of&#xD;
    Cabinet. And they were very responsive to that. And they were very impressed that this was a framework that was&#xD;
    endorsed and developed by the US federal government. And they were also impressed by the alignment with other standards&#xD;
    such as COBIT and ISO, for example.&quot;&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;Since the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is globally applied, it has helped the Cross-Sector Forum have a shared&#xD;
    language among different industry sectors and facilitated our comprehensive discussions between member companies in&#xD;

    PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE NIST CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK TO ASSIST SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES&lt;br />&#xD;
    Perspectives intended to assist small and medium sized businesses.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;NIST understands that not all businesses are created equal, and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are&#xD;
    especially strapped for resources, such as staff and budget, to manage risk. With this reality, the simplicity of the&#xD;
    NIST CSF proves to be valuable....NIST is continuously looking ahead to create a framework that not only addresses&#xD;
    future risks, but does so in a way that provides risk management blueprints for organizations, regardless of their&#xD;
    size.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Richard Tracy, CSO, Telos Corporation&lt;br />&#xD;
    July 15, 2020 - Forbes.com - Small Business, Big Impact With NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework&lt;br />&#xD;
    Siemens has seen a tremendous benefit from using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, not just for ourselves to help&#xD;
    mature our organization, but also with customers. Our customers are looking for clear, simple roadmaps. This is&#xD;
    especially true for small and medium enterprises that have limited budgets and are looking for practical advice to help&#xD;
    them get ready to stop cyber attacks&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;Small businesses have much to gain by working through the Framework. They can use it to build a cybersecurity program&#xD;
    from scratch or help strengthen an existing program. It also represents a valuable professional development exercise by&#xD;
    extending conversations about cybersecurity and risk management across a company.&quot;&#xD;

    “The cybersecurity framework allows organizations—regardless of size, degree of cyber risk, or cybersecurity&#xD;
    sophistication—to apply the principles and best practices of risk management to improve the security and resilience of&#xD;
    critical infrastructure. Organizations can use the framework to determine their current level of cybersecurity, set&#xD;
    goals for cybersecurity that are in sync with their business environment, and establish a plan for improving or&#xD;
    maintaining their cybersecurity. The cybersecurity framework also offers a methodology to protect privacy and civil&#xD;
    liberties to help organizations incorporate those protections into a comprehensive cybersecurity program.”&#xD;
