  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Principles of Management is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of the introductory course on&#xD;
    management. This is a traditional approach to management using the leading, planning, organizing, and controlling&#xD;
    approach. Management is a broad business discipline, and the Principles of Management course covers many management&#xD;
    areas such as human resource management and strategic management, as well as behavioral areas such as motivation. No&#xD;
    one individual can be an expert in all areas of management, so an additional benefit of this text is that specialists&#xD;
    in a variety of areas have authored individual chapters.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it’s our mission to improve student access to education. Our&#xD;
    first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012, and our library has since scaled to over 25 books for&#xD;
    college and AP&amp;reg; courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. OpenStax Tutor, our low-cost personalized learning&#xD;
    tool, is being used in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships with philanthropic foundations&#xD;
    and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to&#xD;
    learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.&#xD;

    About Introduction to Business&lt;br />&#xD;
    Introduction to Business is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of foundational business courses. The&#xD;
    textbook presents business principles and emerging trends in fields including management, leadership, production,&#xD;
    marketing, and finance. Through this content, students will acquire the knowledge, skills, and competencies to prepare&#xD;
    for the competitive workplace.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coverage and scope&lt;br />&#xD;
    Introduction to Business covers the scope and sequence of most introductory business courses. The book provides&#xD;
    detailed explanations in the context of core themes such as ethics, entrepreneurship, customer satisfaction, global&#xD;
    business, and managing change. Introduction to Business includes hundreds of current business examples from a range of&#xD;
    industries, geographic locations, and featuring a variety of individuals. The outcome is a balanced approach to the&#xD;
    theory and application of business concepts, with attention to the knowledge and skills necessary for student success&#xD;
    in this course and beyond.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Pedagogical foundation&lt;br />&#xD;
    Consistent, integrated learning. Targeted learning outcomes are listed at the beginning of each chapter and then&#xD;
    repeated throughout the chapter. The learning outcomes connect to the text and the additional resources that accompany&#xD;
    Introduction to Business. After reading each section, students can test their retention by answering the questions in&#xD;
    the Concept Checks. Every learning goal is further reinforced by a summary.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Hundreds of business examples to bring concepts to life. This book is designed to speak to the typical student. We have&#xD;
    done a lot of research about student needs, abilities, experiences, and interests, and then we have shaped the text&#xD;
    around them. We have used experiences both inside and outside the classroom to enrich a book that is both readable and&#xD;
    enjoyable. We believe that the real business applications found throughout every chapter set the standard for&#xD;
    readability and understanding of key concepts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Learning business terminology, made easy. As students begin to study business, they will explore new words and&#xD;
    concepts. To help them learn this language of business, we define each new term in the chapter, display the terms in&#xD;
    bold, and offer a complete glossary at the end of the book.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Engaging business themes&lt;br />&#xD;
    Ethics. Business presents outstanding opportunities to do good. Through responsible business practices and the&#xD;
    development and distribution of helpful products and services, businesspeople can positively affect their community. A&#xD;
    paramount theme of this text is that business must be conducted in an ethical and socially responsible manner. Chapter&#xD;
    2, Making Ethical Decisions and Managing a Socially Responsible Business, is completely devoted to business ethics and&#xD;
    social responsibility. We discuss techniques for setting personal ethical standards, how managers influence&#xD;
    organizational ethics, tools for creating employee ethical awareness, and the concept of individual and corporate&#xD;
    responsibility. Introduction to Business also features ethics activities at the end of each chapter. All ethical&#xD;
    dilemmas are taken right out of today’s business world.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Customer satisfaction and quality. Because customer satisfaction and quality are the foundation of all business&#xD;
    principles, these important topics are addressed in most chapters within Introduction to Business. Each chapter&#xD;
    stresses that satisfied customers who experience high-quality products and services become loyal customers. A box in&#xD;
    every chapter called “Customer Satisfaction and Quality” demonstrates how these concepts are applied in actual&#xD;
    companies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Managing change. Change in the business or consumer environment can lead to failures like Kodak’s and successes like&#xD;
    Apple’s. The Managing Change boxed feature describes how companies have recognized and responded to changes in&#xD;
    technology, competition, economic forces, demographics, and culture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Entrepreneurship and small business management. Because many students will either open their own businesses or go to&#xD;
    work for small organizations, entrepreneurship and small business principles are covered throughout the text. Chapter&#xD;
    5, Entrepreneurship: Starting and Managing Your Own Business, delivers interesting discussions on starting and managing&#xD;
    a small business and the associated advantages and disadvantages. In addition, a feature called “Catching the&#xD;
    Entrepreneurial Spirit” offers practical insights into the challenges and rewards of actually owning and managing a&#xD;
    small business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Global business economy. In Chapter 3, Competing in the Global Marketplace, we discuss why global trade is important to&#xD;
    the United States, why nations trade, barriers to international trade, how companies enter the global marketplace, and&#xD;
    a host of other international concepts and topics. The Trends section of each chapter frequently includes a discussion&#xD;
    of how globalization will affect specific business activities. In addition, our Global Business box demonstrates how&#xD;
    businesses are expanding their workforce, products, and customer base throughout the world in order to grow.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Features&lt;br />&#xD;
    Rather than provide a dry recitation of facts, we illustrate concepts with contemporary examples. In addition to the&#xD;
    in-text examples, we have several boxed features that provide more extensive examples in areas of importance in today’s&#xD;
    business environment. Each of the boxed features described below includes a series of critical thinking questions to&#xD;
    prompt the student to consider the implications of each business strategy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ethics in Practice. Ethics in Practice features demonstrate how businesses are responsible not only to the bottom line,&#xD;
    but to providing goods and services in a responsible manner.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Customer Satisfaction and Quality. Because customer satisfaction and quality are essential to attracting and keeping&#xD;
    customers, the Customer Satisfaction and Quality box addresses how these concepts are illustrated and applied in actual&#xD;
    companies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Expanding Around the Globe. Upon entering today’s workplace, you are very likely to conduct business with colleagues,&#xD;
    clients, and vendors from around the world. The Expanding Around the Globe feature offers insights into the global&#xD;
    economy and highlights the strategies firms take to expand their business and improve their productivity by utilizing&#xD;
    global resources.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Managing Change. The turbulent business climate requires companies to adapt their business strategies in response to a&#xD;
    variety of economic, social, competitive, and technological forces. The Managing Change feature highlights how&#xD;
    businesses have altered their business strategies in response to these forces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Catching the Entrepreneurial Spirit. This feature highlights the challenges and opportunities available in small&#xD;
    businesses and other entrepreneurial ventures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Activities and cases that put knowledge to work&lt;br />&#xD;
    Introduction to Business helps students develop a solid grounding in the skills that they can apply in the workplace.&#xD;
    These skill-building activities and resources help build and polish competencies that future employers will value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Preparing for tomorrow’s workplace skills and team activities. These activities are designed to help build students’&#xD;
    business skills and to help them practice teamwork. We have developed assignments focused on five important workplace&#xD;
    competencies: using and allocating resources, working with others, acquiring and using information, understanding&#xD;
    systems, and working with technology. Team activities in every chapter give students an opportunity to work together,&#xD;
    building communication skills and interpersonal skills.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ethics activities. Ethics activities at the end of each chapter present real-world ethical challenges and prompt&#xD;
    students to choose the most ethical course of action.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Working the net activities. These activities guide students through a step-by-step analysis of actual e-business&#xD;
    practices and give them opportunities to build online research skills.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Creative thinking cases. The Creative Thinking case in each chapter invites students to explore business strategies of&#xD;
    various companies, analyze business decisions, and prepare comments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Additional resources&lt;br />&#xD;
    Community Hubs&lt;br />&#xD;
    OpenStax partners with the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME) to offer Community Hubs&#xD;
    on OER Commons – a platform for instructors to share community-created resources that support OpenStax books, free of&#xD;
    charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own materials or download resources to use in their&#xD;
    own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching material, multimedia, and relevant course content. We encourage&#xD;
    instructors to join the hubs for the subjects most relevant to your teaching and research as an opportunity both to&#xD;
    enrich your courses and to engage with other faculty.&#xD;

    for delivering the content in an interesting and dynamic manner. The instructor’s manual includes an in-depth lecture&#xD;
    outline, which is interspersed with lecture “tidbits” that allow instructors to add timely and interesting enhancements&#xD;
    to their lectures. Authored by Linda Hefferin, Elgin Community College.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test bank. With nearly 2,000 true/false, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short answer questions in our test&#xD;
    bank, instructors can customize tests to support a variety of course objectives. The test bank is available in Word&#xD;
    format. Authored by Amit Shah, Frostburg State University.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
