    Informative References&lt;br />&#xD;
    The National Cybersecurity Online Informative References Program is a NIST effort to facilitate subject matter experts&#xD;
    (SMEs) in defining standardized online informative references (OLIRs) between elements of their cybersecurity, privacy,&#xD;
    and workforce documents and elements of other cybersecurity, privacy, and workforce documents like the Cybersecurity&#xD;
    Framework. At this stage of the OLIR Program evolution, the initial focus is on relationships to cybersecurity and&#xD;
    privacy documents. NIST Interagency or Internal Report (IR) 8278, National Cybersecurity Online Informative References&#xD;
    (OLIR) Program: Program Overview and OLIR Uses describes the OLIR Program, focusing on explaining what OLIRs are, how&#xD;
    they can be beneficial, and how subject matter experts can contribute OLIRs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The OLIRs are in a simple standard format defined by NIST Interagency or Internal Report (IR) 8278A, National&#xD;
    Cybersecurity Online Informative References (OLIR) Program: Submission Guidance for OLIR Developers and are displayed&#xD;
    within the OLIR Catalog. NISTIR 8278A provides guidance to Informative Reference developers for completing and&#xD;
    submitting OLIRs. NIST analyzes the submitted OLIRs for correctness, works with submitters regarding any corrections,&#xD;
    and hosts links to the public draft and final versions of the OLIRs. By following this approach, cybersecurity document&#xD;
    owners can use the OLIR Program as a mechanism for communicating with owners and users of other cybersecurity documents&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The OLIR Program integrates ongoing NIST projects that respond to administrative and legislative requirements,&#xD;
    including those for the Cybersecurity Framework. The OLIR Program also addresses many Office of Management and Budget&#xD;
    (OMB) memoranda that address specific cybersecurity issues and comprise large sets of regulations with which&#xD;
    organizations must comply. The OLIR Program can represent relationships to any authoritative documents, products, or&#xD;
    services. These resources can be generated from national and international standards, guidelines, frameworks, and&#xD;
    regulations to policies for individual organizations, sectors, or jurisdictions&#xD;
