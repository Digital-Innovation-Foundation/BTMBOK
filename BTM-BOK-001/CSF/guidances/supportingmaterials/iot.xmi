  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Internet of Things has unlimited possibilities for home and business use. Appliances from refrigerators to sensor&#xD;
    networks are now available in models that interact with a wireless network, making them easier to control with a&#xD;
    computer or smartphone. Estimates suggest that there will be more than 75 billion IoT devices in use by 2025, according&#xD;
    to IHS Markit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Along with this massive market adoption of IoT, though, comes a trove of security concerns that necessitate attention&#xD;
    and action. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence&#xD;
    (NCCoE) is striving to make IoT more secure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NCCoE’s work is done in conjunction with and informed by NIST’s Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT) Program.&#xD;
    This program supports the development and application of standards, guidelines, and related tools to improve the&#xD;
    cybersecurity of connected devices and the environments in which they are deployed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Below are the IoT projects that are currently underway at the NCCoE.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Securing Wireless Infusion Pumps&lt;br />&#xD;
    Medical facilities are more connected than ever before, making the delivery of healthcare more efficient and convenient&#xD;
    for patients. The wireless infusion pump device is present in nearly every medical setting.&amp;nbsp; Tampering with the&#xD;
    wireless infusion pump ecosystem can expose a healthcare delivery organization (HDO) enterprise, and by extension its&#xD;
    patients, to serious risks. This project resulted in defense-in-depth cybersecurity guidance applicable to any&#xD;
    connected medical device to help HDOs protect their networks. Learn more about this project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mitigating IoT-Based DDoS&lt;br />&#xD;
    This project aims to improve the resiliency of IoT devices against network-based attacks by using the Internet&#xD;
    Engineering Task Force’s manufacturer usage description (MUD) architecture. When MUD is used, the network will&#xD;
    automatically permit IoT devices to send and receive only the traffic they require to perform as intended, and the&#xD;
    network will prohibit all other communication with the devices. Learn more about this project&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Securing the Industrial Internet of Things: Cybersecurity for Distributed Energy Resources&lt;br />&#xD;
    This project focuses on data integrity and malware prevention, detection, and mitigation within industrial control&#xD;
    systems (ICS). Major consideration is given to distributed energy resources (DERs)—particularly commercial-scale and&#xD;
    utility-scale solar power installations—and their interconnection with the electricity distribution grid. Distributed&#xD;
    energy resources introduce information exchanges between a utility’s distribution control system and the DERs, or an&#xD;
    aggregator, to manage the flow of energy in the distribution grid. These information exchanges often employ Industrial&#xD;
    Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies that lack the communications security present in traditional utility systems.&#xD;
    Learn more about this project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consumer Home Internet of Things Product Security&lt;br />&#xD;
    This project aims to provide data-driven cybersecurity information about the state of the consumer smart home market.&#xD;
    This project provides technical security assessments of consumer home IoT products, with the aim of identifying&#xD;
    security capabilities and recommendations for IoT device manufacturers. These technical assessments will also help the&#xD;
    NCCoE better address consumer home IoT security in a holistic manner in future projects. In addition, the technical&#xD;
    assessments informs the security tenets for IoT devices outlined in NISTIR 8259 (Draft), Core Cybersecurity Feature&#xD;
    Baseline for Securable IoT Devices. Learn more about this project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Security for IoT Sensor Networks&lt;br />&#xD;
    This project aims to demonstrate how resource-constrained sensors can have their firmware securely updated over the air&#xD;
    (OTA). This project will align with draft NISTIR 8259, Recommendations for IoT Device Manufacturers: Foundational&#xD;
    Activities and Core Device Cybersecurity Capability Baseline and seeks to utilize industry standards for&#xD;
    interoperability. Learn more about this effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem&lt;br />&#xD;
    Telehealth is one of the fastest growing sectors within healthcare. It leverages network-connected devices to monitor&#xD;
    and treat patients outside of a healthcare delivery organization’s (HDOs) closed environment. HDOs are leveraging a&#xD;
    combination of telehealth capabilities, such as remote patient monitoring (RPM) and videoconferencing, to treat&#xD;
    patients in their homes. These modalities are used to treat numerous conditions, such as patients battling chronic&#xD;
    illness or requiring postoperative monitoring. As use of these capabilities continues to grow, it is important to&#xD;
    ensure that the infrastructure supporting them can protect patient data. The NCCoE healthcare team and NIST Privacy&#xD;
    teams are working together on this project. Learn more about this project.&#xD;
