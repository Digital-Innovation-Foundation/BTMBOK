    National Cybersecurity Federally Funded Research and Development Center: Strengthening Public Sector&#xD;
    Cybersecurity&lt;br />&#xD;
    To address today’s most pressing cybersecurity challenges, government agencies can now access the unique facilities,&#xD;
    cybersecurity technologies, and expertise of the National Cybersecurity Federally Funded Research and Development&#xD;
    Center (NCF). The NCF is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of secure technolo­gies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NCF supports the mission of the NCCoE at NIST—to collaborate with innovators to provide real- world,&#xD;
    standards-based cybersecurity capabilities that address business needs. NIST sponsors the NCF to meet cybersecurity&#xD;
    research and development needs— and to help demonstrate integrated cybersecurity that is cost-effective, repeatable,&#xD;
    and scalable. As an FFRDC, NCF operates in the public interest with objectivity and no organizational conflicts of&#xD;
    interest. The Work for Others Program, governed by the Program Management Office (PMO) at the National Cybersecurity&#xD;
    Center of Excellence (NCCoE), facilitates engagement with the NCF for contributions to complex and critical cyber&#xD;
    programs and initiatives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Who May Use the NCF?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Federal Agencies&lt;br />&#xD;
    State Governments&lt;br />&#xD;
    Municipal Governments&lt;br />&#xD;
    Not-for-Profit Organizations&lt;br />&#xD;
    Task Areas&lt;br />&#xD;
    NCF provides research, development, engineering, and technical support, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Frameworks and implementation strategies to encourage and expedite adoption of effective cybersecurity controls and&#xD;
    mechanisms&lt;br />&#xD;
    Collaboration across government, industry, and academia to accelerate effective innovation&lt;br />&#xD;
    Systems engineering and technology testing to accelerate adoption of cyber- security technologies by government and&#xD;
    private sectors&lt;br />&#xD;
    Support for technology transfer of cybersecurity solutions&lt;br />&#xD;
    How to Get Started&lt;br />&#xD;
    Submit A Request&lt;br />&#xD;
    Request a needs assessment form by emailing the NCCoE PMO at &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;mailto:FFRDC_Requests@NIST.gov&quot;>FFRDC_Requests@NIST.gov&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requests Reviewed&lt;br />&#xD;
    Needs assessment is reviewed to ensure it is within scope of the NCF IDIQ contract* and meets the additional criteria&#xD;
    shown below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) Prepared&lt;br />&#xD;
    This is an assisted acquisition. The NCCoE PMO will collaborate with your agency to prepare any necessary documentation&#xD;
    for an IAA (e.g., SOW; IGCE; Market Research Report; FMS Forms 7600A and B.)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Proposal Submission and Task Order Award&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NIST Acquisition Management Division will issue an RFP to The MITRE Corporation. We will work with your agency to&#xD;
    negotiate for the best value in terms of cost and technical approaches. A Task Order will be awarded to MITRE for the&#xD;
    approved work proposal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For more information, please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:FFRDC_Requests@NIST.gov&quot;>FFRDC_Requests@NIST.gov&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
