    Logical activities and processes are at the heart of any IT architecture and care should be taken to ensure that they&#xD;
    are accurately captured.&#xD;

    An important objective is to make this model easily consumable by business people, with the goal to ensuring that this&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>Ensure that the name for the activity or process conveys its meaning and that the description supports this meaning.&#xD;
Business experts and stakeholders are key to ensuring that this is the case, however the prime audience is now technical&#xD;
people, therefore a more technical approach is taken to their structure and definition.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>In this age of totally interconnected systems it is imperative that the owners of activities and processes are identified&#xD;
since they must be involved in making decisions regarding the implementation, usage and protections afforded to them.&#xD;
Business experts provide advice on their definitions, but the process owners make final decisions especially where there is&#xD;
confusion or when important aspects need be updated.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Logical Processes are often triggered by Logical Entities, the arrival of an Invoice for example will trigger the &quot;Bill&#xD;
Payment&quot; process. This should be captured at an appropriate level of detail.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Activities and processes produce and consume entities, if this is important then the entities and this usage should be&#xD;
captured. Having a lot of entities on the process diagram gets very confusing and doesn't add value, so only add them to&#xD;
the process model diagram if they are important to understanding the model.</sectionDescription>
