    Maritime: Oil &amp;amp; Natural Gas&lt;br />&#xD;
    With the help of the NCCoE, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) collaborated with industry to develop voluntary&#xD;
    Cybersecurity Framework Profiles (CFP) to mitigate risks in their joint mission areas.&amp;nbsp; Learn more about this&#xD;

    Seeking Additional Projects&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NCCoE is seeking input from members of transportation sectors to identify cybersecurity challenges that the center&#xD;
    can address in collaboration with vendors of commercially available products.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As with the center's other use cases, we are interested in issues that whole sectors (e.g.: automotive, rail, shipping,&#xD;
    etc.) must contend with, so that our work is broadly applicable. Once we have identified a challenge or challenges, we&#xD;
    will publish drafts of the technical descriptions and ask for public feedback. After incorporating that feedback, we&#xD;
    will publish a Federal Register Notice inviting vendors of commercially available products to work in our labs to&#xD;
    generate end-to-end example solutions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ultimately, the NCCoE will publish freely available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guides that will show others how they&#xD;
    can achieve the same results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To suggest a use case idea, email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nccoe@nist.gov&quot;>nccoe@nist.gov&lt;/a>.&#xD;
