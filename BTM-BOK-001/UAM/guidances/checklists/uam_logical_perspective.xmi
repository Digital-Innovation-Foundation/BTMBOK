    The checklist below is provided to help in determining if the Logical Perspective is complete, well-defined and&#xD;
    comprehensible. An overall review is suggested,&amp;nbsp;and reviews and checks for the various aspects are provided. Again&#xD;
    it must be stressed that clear language and consistency in its usage is important in documenting and communicating the&#xD;
    architecture. This is particularly important at the business level, but also at the logical level.&#xD;

    &lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica-Bold&quot;>Overall, the architecture is sound, because:&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The architecture appears to be stable. &#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            The need for stability is dictated by follow-on phases. Instability at this level results in even higher&#xD;
            instability in the lower level&amp;nbsp;Technical Perspective.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            The importance of a stable architecture cannot be overstated. Do not be deceived into thinking that &quot;pretty&#xD;
            close is good&quot;â€”unstable is unstable, and it is better to get the architecture right and delay the move to the&#xD;
            Logical or Technical view rather than proceed.&amp;nbsp;Changes to higher level&amp;nbsp;architecture perspectives and&#xD;
            viewpoint models have broad impact: they tend to be expensive, disruptive and demoralizing.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            The real difficulty of assessing architectural stability is that &quot;you don't know what you don't know&quot;;&#xD;
            stability is measured relative to expected change. As a result, stability is essentially a subjective measure.&#xD;
            We can, however, base this subjectivity on more than just conjecture. The architecture itself is developed by&#xD;
            considering 'architecturally significant' scenariosâ€”sub-sets of activities that represent the most&#xD;
            technologically challenging behavior the system must support. Assessing the stability of the architecture&#xD;
            involves ensuring that the architecture has broad coverage, to ensure that there will be no 'surprises' in the&#xD;
            architecture going forward.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            Past experience with the architecture can also be a good indicator: if the rate of change in the architecture&#xD;
            is low, and remains low as new scenarios are covered, there is good reason to believe that the architecture is&#xD;
            stabilizing. Conversely, if each new scenario causes changes in the architecture, it is still evolving and&#xD;
            baselining is not yet warranted.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The architecture is consistent, coherent and comprehensible&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The architect can understand enough from the architecture to successfully develop the&amp;nbsp;Technical Perspective.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The packaging approach reduces complexity and improves understanding.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        Packages have been defined to be highly cohesive within the package, while the packages themselves are loosely&#xD;
        coupled.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The&amp;nbsp;architecture can be easily understood by someone generally knowledgeable in the business area.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;

        The Logical Perspective viewpoint models and included documentation is current.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The architecture does not appear to be &quot;over-designed&quot;. &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;

    If it is the case, the system model will in general appear to be reasonable. Past experience with the architecture can&#xD;
    be a good indicator if the rate of change in the architecture is low, and remains low as new scenarios are covered,&#xD;
    there is good reason to believe that the architecture is stabilizing. Conversely, if each new scenario causes changes&#xD;
    in the architecture, it is still evolving and baselining is not yet warranted. One must not get too hasty in viewing&#xD;
    model as 'unstable', since this view could be caused by the influence of technological change, which in turn may impact&#xD;
    the businessâ€”in other words, a Logical model if crafted well is independent of technological change to some degree, and&#xD;
    defines the important aspects of the given business domain (e.g., car manufacturing, or retail sales, etc.). This&#xD;
    independence, to some degree, of the model from changes in technology (i.e., in how technology support business&#xD;
    activity) may not hold if the business is heavily dependent, driven&amp;nbsp;and involved in information technology; if the&#xD;
    enterprise is &lt;em>in&lt;/em> the information technology business, such as a telecommunications or computer equipment&#xD;
    manufacturer.&#xD;
