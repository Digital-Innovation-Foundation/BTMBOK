    7&lt;br />&#xD;
    7 plus or minus 2&lt;br />&#xD;
    The number of items that can be held in short-term memory or that can be the focus of attention, as stated by George A.&#xD;
    Miller in his 1956 paper. The number applies only to retention and recall of information, and not to recognition. &quot;The&#xD;
    Magic Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information&quot; (The Psychological&#xD;
    Review, 1956, vol. 63, pp. 81-97).&#xD;

    Accessibility&lt;br />&#xD;
    The attributes and characteristics of a system that allow people with limited vision, hearing, dexterity, cognition or&#xD;
    physical mobility to interact effectively with the system. Standards and guidelines are available, and standards may be&#xD;
    legally enforced in some markets. Accessibility aids, such as screen readers, may be added to a system to allow people&#xD;
    with disabilities to use those systems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    Affinity Diagramming&lt;br />&#xD;
    Affinity diagramming is a participatory method where concepts written on cards are sorted into related groups and&#xD;
    sub-groups. The original intent of affinity diagramming was to help diagnose complicated problems by organizing&#xD;
    qualitative data to reveal themes associated with the problems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Synonyms: Mind mapping&lt;br />&#xD;
    Affordance&lt;br />&#xD;
    The properties of an object that inform people how the object could be used. The term 'perceived affordance' applies&#xD;
    when the object properties are perceived in a way that differs from the real-world, physical properties, especially&#xD;
    when the usage of the object depends on perceived rather than real-world properties.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    B&lt;br />&#xD;
    Braindrawing&lt;br />&#xD;
    Braindrawing is a type of visual brainstorming in which a group of participants sketch ideas for designs, icons, screen&#xD;
    layouts, or other visual concepts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See also: Brainstorming&lt;br />&#xD;
    Brainstorming&lt;br />&#xD;
    A method for generating ideas, intended to inspire the free-flowing sharing of thoughts of an individual or a group of&#xD;
    people, typically while withholding criticism in order to promote uninhibited thinking.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See also: Braindrawing, Brainwriting, Metaphor Brainstorming&lt;br />&#xD;
    Brainwriting&lt;br />&#xD;
    Brainwriting is a method for quickly generating ideas by asking participants to write their ideas on paper (or online)&#xD;
    rather than announcing them in traditional group brainstorming sessions. Brainwriting has the advantage of parallel&#xD;
    idea generation. In traditional group brainstorming, only one idea can be presented at a time (a serial process). In&#xD;
    brainwriting, you can have the entire group writing ideas at the same time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    C&lt;br />&#xD;
    Card Sorting&lt;br />&#xD;
    A method for organizing information that involves sorting a series of cards into groups that make sense to the&#xD;
    participants. Each card represents a single term, function or object. Card sorting helps to reveal users' mental&#xD;
    models, or patterns that the end users would expect to find.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Case Study&lt;br />&#xD;
    A way of learning about a complex instance through extensive description and analysis. The case study articulates why&#xD;
    the instance occurred as it did by exploring the factors contributing to its success or failure, and what one might&#xD;
    consider in similar situations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Checklist&lt;br />&#xD;
    A checklist is a predefined set of guidelines, tasks, or other items against which products, processes, behaviors, user&#xD;
    interface components, or something else, are compared.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Chunking&lt;br />&#xD;
    The human ability to group information into related small sets, which can then be stored in short-term memory. By&#xD;
    keeping information in smaller pieces, the functional storage capacity of the brain is increased. Information is often&#xD;
    presented in a chunked format to facilitate human memory, for example North American phone numbers are often grouped&#xD;
    into the xxx-xxx-xxxx pattern. Familiarly with the information and/or rehearsal of it increases the person's ability to&#xD;
    remember the information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Claims Analysis&lt;br />&#xD;
    Claims analysis is a technique for examining the positive and negative consequences of design features that are&#xD;
    described in current or future scenarios of use. A &quot;claim&quot; is a statement of the consequences of a specific design&#xD;
    feature or artifact on users and other stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Cognitive Walkthrough&lt;br />&#xD;
    The cognitive walkthrough is a usability evaluation method in which one or more evaluators work through a series of&#xD;
    tasks and ask a set of questions from the perspective of the user.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See also: Heuristic Walkthrough, Pluralistic Usability Walkthrough&lt;br />&#xD;
    Competitor Analysis&lt;br />&#xD;
    A method for identifying the strengths and weaknesses of competing products or services before starting work on&#xD;
    prototypes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Conspicuity&lt;br />&#xD;
    The characteristics of a graphic element that enable the audience to differentiate the element from its surrounding&#xD;
    environment. Conspicuity is achieved when each element can easily be distinguished separately by the user.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Context of Use Analysis&lt;br />&#xD;
    Collecting and analyzing detailed information about the intended users, their tasks, and the technical and&#xD;
    environmental constraints. The data for a context of use analysis can be gathered using interviews, workshops, surveys,&#xD;
    site visits, artifact analysis, focus groups, observational studies, and contextual inquiry.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Contextual Inquiry&lt;br />&#xD;
    A semi-structured field interviewing method based on a set of principles that allow it to be molded to different&#xD;
    situations. This technique is generally used at the beginning of the design process and is good for getting rich&#xD;
    information, but can be complex and time consuming.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See also: Ethnography, Field Study&lt;br />&#xD;
    Critical Incident Technique (CIT)&lt;br />&#xD;
    A method of gathering facts (incidents) from domain experts or less experienced users of the existing system to gain&#xD;
    knowledge of how to improve the performance of the individuals involved. CIT is used to look for the cause of&#xD;
    human-system (or product) problems to minimize loss to person, property, money or data.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Cultural Probe&lt;br />&#xD;
    Cultural probes are sets of simple artifacts (such as maps, postcards, cameras, or diaries) that are given to users for&#xD;
    them to record specific events, feelings or interactions in their usual environment, in order to get to know them and&#xD;
    their culture better. Cultural probes are used to uncover aspects of culture and human interaction like emotions,&#xD;
    values, connections, and trust.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See also: Diary Study, Photo Study&lt;br />&#xD;
    Culture&lt;br />&#xD;
    The shared set of habits, customs, knowledge, beliefs, language, and behaviors that set one group of people apart from&#xD;
    others. This grouping may range from very large to very small groups (such as an office or a business). Culture is&#xD;
    invisible to people who are part of it, and often incomprehensible to people who are encountering a specific culture&#xD;
    for the first time. The risk of culture for usability is that culture is a deep source of unstated assumptions. These&#xD;
    assumptions need to be identified and stated explicitly before they can be incorporated into a usable design.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See also: Ethnography&lt;br />&#xD;
    D&lt;br />&#xD;
    Diary Study&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ethnography&lt;br />&#xD;
    The process of gathering information about users and tasks directly from users in their normal work, home or leisure&#xD;
    environment. Traditional more on Ethnography)&quot;&amp;gt;ethnography focuses on long-term studies spanning weeks, months, or&#xD;
    even years. Information may be collected through participant observation, interviews, audio or video recording,&#xD;
    observer logs, artifact collection, diaries and photographs. (more on Ethnography)&#xD;

    Facilitator&lt;br />&#xD;
    A person that works with a person or group to lead a discussion or activity in order to extract feedback and&#xD;
    information. A facilitator's goals might include developing an understanding of a situation or objective, help achieve&#xD;
    consensus, understand the differences or obstacles that stand in the way of the end goals, and clarify various view&#xD;
    points. Key skills for a facilitator include timekeeping, application of behavioral tools to help achieve the desired&#xD;
    test or activity goals, listening, asking questions, suggesting alternatives, and moving the test or activity forward&#xD;
    and keeping records. A facilitator might preside over various forms of user research.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Synonyms: Cause-and-effect diagram, Fault tree diagram, Ishikawa diagram, Root cause analysis&lt;br />&#xD;
    Fitts' Law&lt;br />&#xD;
    The further away a target is, and the smaller its size, the longer it will take for a user to reach it. The time&#xD;
    required to move from a starting point to within the confines of a target area is dependent on a logarithmic&#xD;
    relationship between the distance from the point to the target area and the size of the target.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Focus Group&lt;br />&#xD;
    A focus group is a focused discussion where a moderator leads a group of participants through a set of questions on a&#xD;
    particular topic. Focus groups are often used in the early stages of product planning and requirements gathering to&#xD;
    obtain feedback about users, products, concepts, prototypes, tasks, strategies, and environments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See also: Moderator&lt;br />&#xD;
    Formative Evaluation&lt;br />&#xD;
    Formative evaluation is a type of usability evaluation that helps to 'form' the design for a product or service.&#xD;
    Formative evaluations involve evaluating a product or service during development, often iteratively, with the goal of&#xD;
    detecting and eliminating usability problems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Free Listing&lt;br />&#xD;
    Free listing is a technique for gathering data about a specific domain or topic by asking people to list all the items&#xD;
    they can think of that relate to the topic. It can be used to gather data in large group settings or in one-on-one&#xD;
    interviews.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Function Allocation&lt;br />&#xD;
    Function allocation is a classic human factors method for deciding whether a particular function will be accomplished&#xD;
    by a person, technology (hardware or software) or some mix of person and technology. To do this, the investigator&#xD;
    considers error rates, fatigue, costs, hazards, technological feasibility, human values, ethical issues, and the desire&#xD;
    of people to perform the function.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    G&lt;br />&#xD;
    Gestalt Principles&lt;br />&#xD;
    Humans visually perceive items not in isolation, but as part of a larger whole. These principles include humans&#xD;
    tendencies towards similarity, proximity, continuity, and closure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Graceful Degradation&lt;br />&#xD;
    Systems should be designed so that when features that take advantage of new technologies are disabled, the content&#xD;
    maintains effectiveness for the users. For example, older Web browsers and browsers which allow users to disable&#xD;
    features will display page content in a simplified format.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    H&lt;br />&#xD;
    Heuristic&lt;br />&#xD;
    A usability guideline for evaluating a user interface, which can be used to identify design problems. Usability&#xD;
    heuristics often need to be adjusted depending on the interface and the technology used. There are lists of heuristics&#xD;
    that have been compiled by various people and organizations that are commonly used for this method.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Heuristic Evaluation&lt;br />&#xD;
    A usability evaluation method in which one or more reviewers, preferably experts, compare a software, documentation, or&#xD;
    hardware product to a list of design principles (commonly referred to as heuristics) and identify where the product&#xD;
    does not follow those principles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Heuristic Walkthrough&lt;br />&#xD;
    A type of inspection that combines aspects of heuristic evaluation, the cognitive walkthrough, and the pluralistic&#xD;
    usability walkthrough.&#xD;

    A measure of the degree to which an interface can be easily and accurately read; an attribute of a usable system. The&#xD;
    level of difficulty of vocabulary and the complexity of sentences in a written text usually ranked by the age or grade&#xD;
    level required for a person to readily understand the text. People can more easily perceive a message correctly when&#xD;
    the vocabulary and sentences are simple and clear.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    S&lt;br />&#xD;
    Scenario&lt;br />&#xD;
    A story which has the key elements of a realistic situation when the user would interact with the system being designed&#xD;
    or evaluated. The scenario includes consideration of the user's goals, tasks and interaction. Scenarios can be created&#xD;
    for user groups, workflows or tasks to explore, understand and test the different types of needs and goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Site Map&lt;br />&#xD;
    A representation of the information that can be found on a Website or of a system. When presented as content on a&#xD;
    Website it is typically organized in a hierarchical listing. Alternatively, the same information can be represented&#xD;
    with boxes and arrows that visually show the hierarchy of the interface.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Storyboard&lt;br />&#xD;
    A technique for illustrating an interaction between a person and a product (or multiple people and multiple products)&#xD;
    in narrative format, which includes a series of drawings, sketches, or pictures and sometimes words that tell a story.&#xD;
    Read more about the Storyboard method.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    T&lt;br />&#xD;
    Task&lt;br />&#xD;
    The procedures that include goals, steps, skills, start state, inputs, end state, and outputs required to accomplish an&#xD;
    activity. They can be organized into larger tasks such as driving to work and sub-tasks such as opening the car door.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Taxonomy&lt;br />&#xD;
    A scheme for classifying a body of knowledge and defining the relationships among the pieces. Sometimes referred to as&#xD;
    a controlled vocabulary, a taxonomy is often used to classify content to aid in the creation of information&#xD;
    architecture. SEE Information Architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Testing (Usability)&lt;br />&#xD;
    The process of validating that a system meets pre-specified usability objectives. These objectives should be&#xD;
    task-based, and should tie directly to product requirements, including results from analytic tools such as personas,&#xD;
    scenarios, and task analysis. Testing may validate a number of objective and subjective characteristics, including task&#xD;
    completion, time on task, error rates, and user satisfaction. Testing may be formal or informal, may be local (with&#xD;
    testers physically present at same location as users) or remote, and may result in qualitative or quantitative data.&#xD;
    Testing may occur at any point in the development cycle, from early analysis through product delivery and beyond.&#xD;
    Testing may be based on paper designs, models, or display mock-ups, as well as on products in development and completed&#xD;
    products.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Think-aloud Protocol&lt;br />&#xD;
    A direct observation method of user testing that involves asking users to think out loud as they are performing a task.&#xD;
    Users are asked to say whatever they are looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling at each moment. This method is&#xD;
    especially helpful for determining users' expectations and identifying what aspects of a system are confusing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    U&lt;br />&#xD;
    Usability&lt;br />&#xD;
    Usability is the degree to which something - software, hardware or anything else - is easy to use and a good fit for&#xD;
    the people who use it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usability Engineering&lt;br />&#xD;
    The disciplined application of usability practices to assess the needs and abilities of users, in conjunction with the&#xD;
    business requirements, practices, and processes of an organization. These are combined to develop an effective user&#xD;
    experience, and to integrate that experience into a product or service. Usability engineering also encompasses the&#xD;
    business and interpersonal skills to work effectively with the business and development organizations to integrate&#xD;
    usability practices and goals within the overall development, marketing, support, training, and quality assurance&#xD;
    processes of the product group.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usability Evaluation&lt;br />&#xD;
    Assessing the usability of a product with the purpose of identifying usability problems and/or obtaining usability&#xD;
    measures. The purpose of evaluation can be to improve the usability of the product as part of design/development&#xD;
    (formative evaluation), or to assess the extent to which usability objectives have been achieved (summative&#xD;
    evaluation).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    User Experience (UE)&lt;br />&#xD;
    Every aspect of the user's interaction with a product, service, or company that make up the user's perceptions of the&#xD;
    whole. User experience design as a discipline is concerned with all the elements that together make up that interface,&#xD;
    including layout, visual design, text, brand, sound, and interaction. UE works to coordinate these elements to allow&#xD;
    for the best possible interaction by users.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    User-Centered Design (UCD)&lt;br />&#xD;
    An approach or philosophy that emphasizes early and continuous involvement of users in the design and evaluation&#xD;
    process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    W&lt;br />&#xD;
    Wayfinding&lt;br />&#xD;
    How people orient themselves and navigate in a built environment, both physical and virtual.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Wireframe&lt;br />&#xD;
    Rough outline of navigation and content elements that make up a user interface. Typically visual design and precise&#xD;
    layout are not addressed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See also: Paper Prototyping, Rapid Prototyping&lt;br />&#xD;
    Wizard of Oz&lt;br />&#xD;
    A user-based evaluation of unimplemented technology where, generally unknown to the user, a human or team is simulating&#xD;
    some or all the responses of the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
