    This is the root model for a Simple Architecture at the Business Line (BL) level and is based upon the ThuNorTech IT&#xD;
    Research Business Line level architecture. It only&amp;nbsp;contains&amp;nbsp;one perspective, the Technical level and also&#xD;
    only the Locations aspect. &amp;nbsp;&quot;IT Research&quot; within ThuNorTech can be compared to any IT information supplier and IT&#xD;
    solutions consultant.&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is the root of the Unified Model at the Business Line (BL) level of a small company called ThuNorTech. This&#xD;
    simplified architecture, based upon the ThuNorTech IT Research Business Line level architecture, is focused upon the IT&#xD;
    network architecture within this business line and how the it should be architected to support them. Information was&#xD;
    also obtained from the &quot;IT Research - Distribute Research&quot; business domain level architecture. Consolidation and&#xD;
    rationalization of the network architecture was the objective. Given the objective of this simplified architecture, the&#xD;
    results are documented in the Location Aspect in the Technical Perspective. The other aspects do not contain any models&#xD;
    since they were superfluous to the objectives of the IT architecture study.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    ThuNorTech does research, as required by customers, on specific aspects of technology such as technology trends,&#xD;
    technology comparisons and suppliers of technology. ThuNorTech's scope includes hardware and software aspects of&#xD;
    information technology as well as supporting tools and technologies such as software IDEs, desktop and middleware&#xD;
    software, and architecture tools and techniques, etc. The company also provides solutions to customers (i.e. the IT&#xD;
    Solutions Business Line), and optionally the management and operation of these solutions.&#xD;
