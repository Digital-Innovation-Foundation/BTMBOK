The following 6 apps are most important for the collaborative DevOps methods used to develop and publish BOK assets on GitLab. These apps fit within a Continuous Integration / Continuous Integration Development (CI/CD) cycle.

BTM BOK serves as a reference web site to guide practitioners at all levels of Competency: Associate, Professional, Manager, and Executive. It provides a generic core model "centered" on business value and technology, instructing what knowledge and certifications are required to enter new BTM positions and guiding upcoming digital leaders toward the common core competencies of their profession. The [Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) Composer](https://www.eclipse.org/epf/) is used to develop and design the BTM BOK library integrating various external plugins and assets in a single BOK. The [EPF Wiki (a Ruby app)](https://wiki.eclipse.org/EPF_Wiki_User_Guide) is used to publish, maintain and add contents to the BOK developed in EPF. A Zotero references app is developed and integrated in EPF Wiki to allow for easy insertion of academic and professional literature citations.

BTM BOK mapping application allows members to create mappings or associations between various industry standards and BTM positions to identify and create competencies. Currently 1729 standards and 33 positions information are added and ordered hierarchically. The mapping app also includes adding references and citations through an integrated Zotero references manager app. Each member's created mappings and content can be shared with other members or kept private according to the member intent.
