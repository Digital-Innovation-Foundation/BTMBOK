    ABOUT&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NIST Privacy Framework is a voluntary tool developed in collaboration with stakeholders intended to help&#xD;
    organizations identify and manage privacy risk to build innovative products and services while protecting individuals’&#xD;
    privacy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Resource Repository&lt;br />&#xD;
    This repository contains resources to support organizations’ use of the Privacy Framework. Resources include&#xD;
    crosswalks, common Profiles, guidance, and tools. NIST encourages new contributions and feedback on these resources as&#xD;
    part of the ongoing collaborative effort to improve implementation of the Privacy Framework.&#xD;

    Adoption&lt;br />&#xD;
    LEAD ON PRIVACY&lt;br />&#xD;
    Show leadership in privacy by adopting the Privacy Framework to support:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Building customers’ trust by supporting ethical decision-making in product and service design or deployment that&#xD;
    optimizes beneficial uses of data while minimizing adverse consequences for individuals’ privacy and society as a&#xD;
    whole;&lt;br />&#xD;
    Fulfilling current compliance obligations, as well as future-proofing products and services to meet these obligations&#xD;
    in a changing technological and policy environment; and&lt;br />&#xD;
    Facilitating communication about privacy practices with individuals, business partners, assessors, and&#xD;
    regulators.&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Framework can help you answer the fundamental question, “How are we considering the privacy impacts to individuals&#xD;
    as we develop our systems, products, and services?” To account for the unique needs of your organization, use of the&#xD;
    Framework is flexible, although it is designed to complement existing business and system development operations. For&#xD;
    example, if you already have robust privacy risk management processes, you might use the Core’s five Functions as a&#xD;
    streamlined way to analyze and articulate any gaps. Alternatively, if your organization is seeking to establish a&#xD;
    privacy program, you can use the Core’s Categories and Subcategories as a reference. For a more in depth look at some&#xD;
    of the ways you can use it, see Section 3 of the Framework.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT&lt;br />&#xD;
    Hypothetical Use Cases&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST has developed these hypothetical use cases to improve understanding of how to develop Profiles to increase&#xD;
    collaboration and dialogue across organizations and support risk-based decisions. If you’d like to share a real&#xD;
    implementation success story, contact us.&#xD;
