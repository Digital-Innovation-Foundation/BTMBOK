    Current Status&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NCCoE recently released a draft project description, Continuous Monitoring for IT Infrastructure. The public&#xD;
    comment period closed on July 26, 2019. We appreciate your feedback, which we will use to shape the direction of the&#xD;
    project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Summary&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NCCoE is proposing a project to explore continuous monitoring capabilities that can effectively, efficiently and&#xD;
    automatically detect when a malicious actor, be it an authorized user or external actor, attempts to perform an action&#xD;
    in an organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure that could result in financial, reputational, and operational impacts to the&#xD;
    organization.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many organizations monitor business information technology (IT) infrastructure by manual inspection or computer-aided&#xD;
    audits, which can result in after-the-fact detection of malicious-user access events.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This project will describe how to address this issue by collecting appropriate log data from the IT infrastructure.&#xD;
    Furthermore, the continuous monitoring capabilities can also be used to automate analysis and reporting of the log data&#xD;
    to alert the proper personnel in the organization with actionable information and guidance so they may take measures&#xD;
    toward resolving the detected issue. This project will result in a freely available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide,&#xD;
    which includes a reference architecture, a fully implemented example solution, and a detailed guide of practical steps&#xD;
    needed to implement the solution.&#xD;
