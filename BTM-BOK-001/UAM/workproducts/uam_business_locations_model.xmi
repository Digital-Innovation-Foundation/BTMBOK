  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Location Model defines the high-level business locations where the system has a presence, as defined by&#xD;
    the scope of the modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define the business locations involved, and the sorts of&#xD;
    services provided within and between them. This information is important in deciding on the architecture for&#xD;
    applications and services, so that they operate effectively over a slow speed WAN for example. Security implications&#xD;
    are also eventually derived from this model for example.&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to clearly define the business locations and the relationships between them in terms of the services&#xD;
    (activities/workflows) provided and facilities provided (data/voice, etc.)&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Failure to produce this model means you run the risk that architects and designers will give only superficial attention&#xD;
    to the way the business operates. They will do what they know best, which is to design and build systems in the absence&#xD;
    of proper business knowledge. The result often is that the constructed systems do not support the needs of the&#xD;
    business.&#xD;

    A &lt;strong>Business Locations Model&lt;/strong> may have the following properties:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Introduction:&lt;/b> A textual description that serves as a brief introduction to the model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Packages:&lt;/b> The packages in the model (contained within the Logical Perspective package), representing a&#xD;
        hierarchy stereotyped as «BPL_Location» or&amp;nbsp;«BPL_Domain» or «BPL_Zone».&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Nodes:&lt;/b> The nodes in the model, owned by the packages stereotyped as «BPL_Location»,&amp;nbsp;«BPL_Domain»,&#xD;
        «BPL_Zone», or «BPL_Comms».&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Relationships:&lt;/b> The relationships in the model, owned by the packages stereotyped as «BPL_Comms».&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Diagrams:&lt;/b> The diagrams in the model, owned by the packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Business Locations Model is created to illustrate the conceptual location at which the &quot;system&quot; has a presence. Most&#xD;
    things defined at this stage will go on to be described in detail in the Logical&amp;nbsp;Perspective and Technical&#xD;
    Perspective.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Locations Model is a way of expressing the business conducted at and between locations where it operates.&#xD;
    Locations are conceptual at the highest level, and include &quot;locations&quot; based upon security concepts, see: &lt;a&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_KGs_oMX8EdyDYN2-y9-AqA&quot;>Whitepaper: A Reference Model for Enterprise Security&lt;/a>. The types of locations and&#xD;
    interactions between them are what are modeled. The business activities supported or provided at each conceptual&#xD;
    location are also described.&lt;br />&#xD;
