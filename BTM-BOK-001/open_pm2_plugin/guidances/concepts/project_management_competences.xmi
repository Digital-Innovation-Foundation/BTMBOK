    Developing Project Management Competences
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Project management involves much more than creating schedules and budgets, and Project Managers (PMs) must have a wide
    range of technical and behavioural skills at their disposal.&lt;br />
    To develop the competences required to manage projects effectively.&amp;nbsp; Project Managers (PMs) need to:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            understand how projects are handled within the organisation (talk to colleagues)
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            review any project methodologies, standards and frameworks that exist in the organisation
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            follow a project management course (e.g. a course offered by a recognised PM2 training provider)
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            reflect on their project management—what is successful, what could be improved?
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            become an active member of the PM² Community—participate in forum discussions and learn from questions asked by
            other Project Managers (PMs)
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            talk to more experienced Project Managers (PMs) about how they run their projects.
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    It is up to the Project Manager (PM) to acquire these skills and invest in their project management skills set. Project
    management knowledge comes from study and practice, from discussing, sharing experiences and reflecting on what went
    well and what can be improved.
&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>
    &lt;strong>Fig&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/strong> What Project Managers (PMs) need to understand.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h5>
    Project Management Competences
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>
    Project Managers (PMs) need to:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        understand the project management methodology used in their organisation (e.g. PM²)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        have the technical competences required to effectively manage the initiation, planning, execution, control and
        closing of a project.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    On top of this, the role requires skills to work effectively with people and within the broader organisational context.
    These include the contextual and behavioural skills necessary to manage complex projects with diverse teams and
    stakeholder groups that have pluralistic and conflicting priorities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Project Managers (PMs) thus also need to know/understand:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        how to communicate, lead, motivate, negotiate, solve problems and deal with issues, conduct meetings and workshops,
        report project status, etc
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        the business context and the general project environment (i.e. sociocultural, political, physical, etc.)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        organisational policies and standards (e.g. security, organisational architecture, audits, etc.)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        how the end-product or service will be maintained after it is delivered.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Additionally, subject-specific knowledge (e.g. IT, policy, etc.) is often relevant and useful to a Project Manager’s
    (PM) role.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Most, if not all, of the above-mentioned points are also required of Business Managers (BM).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;br />
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>
    &lt;strong>Tab 1&lt;/strong> Project Manager's competences
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The above competences may not necessarily be independent and each can have an impact on others. However, the filter
    that determines what is more important (e.g. self or common interest, time or quality, results or balance, etc.) lies
    in our values and ethics. Therefore, competences related to the appreciation of values and ethics have a prominent
    position compared to the rest because it is our ethical profile that guides us on how we should apply our competencies,
    and determines what we consider good or bad, right or wrong, in any given situation, decision and action.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Note that Project Managers (PMs) and Business Managers (BMs) should demonstrate these competencies effectively,
    consistently and appropriately to the given situation, while remaining aligned with organisational and professional
    values and ethics. The aim is to achieve the project goals by making (and acting on) the right decisions, at the right
    time, in the right way and for the right reasons. This can be a challenge for Project Managers (PMs), who often face
    tensions between making decisions based on goals and values, and meeting the needs of various stakeholders.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Such decisions and tensions become easier to manage when Project Managers (PMs) have developed an ethical disposition,
    which involves the balancing of goals and skills, personal integrity and moral virtue.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Although all virtues (logical and moral) affect all competences, the virtues of judgment, prudence and insightfulness
    are (comparatively) more related to demonstrating the perspective competencies, while the moral virtues of honesty,
    fairness, friendliness, generosity, temperance, courage, humour, and magnanimity and magnificence, are (comparatively)
    more related to demonstrating people competences.&lt;br />
