  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many analysts, IT experts, business experts, and others involved in the creation, review, and maintenance of&#xD;
    IT architectures. The specifics of their involvement&amp;nbsp;is defined below in terms of &lt;em>management&lt;/em>,&#xD;
    &lt;em>experts&lt;/em> (of various descriptions), support, and of course &lt;em>IT architects&lt;/em>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Management&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are two kinds of managers involved in the development and use of IT architectures: business managers and&#xD;
    technical managers. Managers are involved at the periphery, since most of the development and review of IT&#xD;
    architectures is done by IT architects with the support of business and technical experts. These experts are the key&#xD;
    stakeholders that the architect must work with. Managers are involved when decisions are made regarding the&#xD;
    &lt;em>usage&lt;/em> of the IT architecture (i.e., business planning and project/program planning) and in reviewing or&#xD;
    approving results (i.e., review and approval of Architectural Decisions, and possible review of IT architectures). In&#xD;
    summary:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Manager&lt;/strong> - involved in the definition and approval of various business planning documents,&#xD;
        which are inputs to UAM (see: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/workproducttypes/uam_input_52EEF09E.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_SFa5sEMtEeShYIpiBstbOQ&quot;>UAM Inputs&lt;/a>). They are also involved in&amp;nbsp;program management decisions, and&#xD;
        the required Project Charters definitions.&amp;nbsp; See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../../UAM/roles/uam_bus_manager_2386B4E1.html&quot; guid=&quot;_gqcDMKjDEeSFIOC-Wm7nrA&quot;>Role: Business&#xD;
        Manager&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Technical Manager&lt;/strong> - these managers are very much involved with IT implementation projects:&#xD;
        defining Project Charters, reviewing/approving system designs, managing change, transitions to operation and other&#xD;
        project aspects. They may also get involved with the assessment of completed IT architecture perspectives. Their&#xD;
        most important involvement is in the management and approval of Architecture Decisions. See: &lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/roles/uam_tech_manager_5C4B14C3.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_ytv_AKjAEeSFIOC-Wm7nrA&quot;>Role: Technical Manager&lt;/a>.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Much of this obviously depends upon the organization of&amp;nbsp;your particular business and the associated planning&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Experts&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is a growing list of experts involved in the creation of IT architectures and solutions. The list below is not&#xD;
    complete, and will definitely grow over time as new technologies and specializations are defined. Suffice it to say&#xD;
    that, in general, many of these experts participate directly in developing IT architectures, with IT architects leading&#xD;
    the development. As with management, there are two types of experts: business and technical.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business experts are the stakeholders that understand the business side of the system; they understand the business&#xD;
    process, and other aspects, in detail. They participate directly in the development of the IT architectures,&#xD;
    particularly at the Business and Logical levels. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/roles/uam_business-expert_7F3CC04F.html&quot; guid=&quot;_QDA0sEgdEeShYIpiBstbOQ&quot;>Role: Business Expert&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Technical experts are typically not key stakeholders for the system, but provide advice to IT architectures regarding&#xD;
    the practicalities of the technologies involved. Many designers, at the Business level, do participate directly in the&#xD;
    development of the IT architectures, Business Analysis, GUI designers and others as required. This involvement will&#xD;
    vary depending upon the context and objectives of the IT architecture. A brief summary of some of these experts and&#xD;
    their involvement:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Analyst&lt;/strong> - someone who analyzes the existing or ideal organization and design of systems,&#xD;
        including businesses, departments, and organizations. BAs also assess business models and their integration with&#xD;
        technology. They are deeply involved in defining the Activity and People aspects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business-Process Analysts and Business Designers&lt;/strong> - these experts are typically involved in process&#xD;
        re-engineering, which is done as a first step in defining the Business Perspective.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>GUI Designer&lt;/strong> – designs interfaces that are easy to use and minimize errors on the end-user side.&#xD;
        These interfaces can include web forms, database front ends, computerized invoices and other forms as needed. They&#xD;
        are deeply involved in defining the Activity and People aspects, particularly at the Logical and Technical levels.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Application Architect&lt;/strong> - describes the structure and behavior of applications used in a business,&#xD;
        focused on how they interact with each other and with users. The primary focus is on the data consumed and produced&#xD;
        by applications rather than their internal structure. In application portfolio management, the applications are&#xD;
        usually mapped to business functions and to application platform technologies. They are deeply involved in defining&#xD;
        the Activity and Location aspects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Security Specialist&lt;/strong> – a specialist that defines network security, application level, and other&#xD;
        levels of policies and solutions that controls access to the network, servers, storage and information and prevents&#xD;
        unintended or unauthorized access. They are involved in defining all aspects, but particularly at the Logical and&#xD;
        Technical levels.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>System Architect (Solutions Architect)&lt;/strong> - establishes the basic structure of the computer system,&#xD;
        defining the essential core design features and elements that provide the framework for all that follows, and are&#xD;
        the hardest to change later. The systems architect provides definition of the users' vision for what the system&#xD;
        needs to be and do, and the paths along which it must be able to evolve, and strives to maintain the integrity of&#xD;
        that vision as it evolves during detailed design and implementation They are involved in defining all aspects, but&#xD;
        particularly at the Logical and Technical levels.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Information Analyst&lt;/strong> - analysis and design of the data stored by information systems, concentrating&#xD;
        on entities, their attributes, and their interrelationships. The modeling of data for an individual database and&#xD;
        the corporate data models that an enterprise uses. They are involved in defining the Data aspect, and to some&#xD;
        extent the Activity aspect.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Storage Architect&lt;/strong> -&amp;nbsp; the practice of designing the structure, locations and types of storage&#xD;
        devices to be used within an enterprise or system. They are involved in defining the Location aspect, and to some&#xD;
        extent the Activity aspect, particularly at the Logical and Technical levels.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Server Architect&lt;/strong> - the practice of designing the structure, locations and types of server&#xD;
        (computing) devices to be used within an enterprise or system. They are involved in defining the Location aspect,&#xD;
        and to some extent the Activity aspect, particularly at the Logical and Technical levels.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Network Architect&lt;/strong> - the specification of the physical components and their organization and&#xD;
        configuration, operational principles and procedures, as well as data formats used to implement an enterprise or&#xD;
        system telecomm or IP network. They are involved in defining the Location aspect, but particularly at the Logical&#xD;
        and Technical levels.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Technical (Hardware) Architect&lt;/strong> - the practice of designing the structure and types of&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        hardware and software components to be used within an enterprise or system They are involved in defining the&#xD;
        Location aspect, but particularly at the Logical and Technical levels.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many IT experts involved, as required, in the development of the IT architecture. There involvement ensures&#xD;
    that the architecture is practical, implementable, and maintainable. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/roles/uam_it-expert_BFB95C0D.html&quot; guid=&quot;_d5H60EgbEeShYIpiBstbOQ&quot;>Role: IT Expert&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    IT Architects&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IT architects are&amp;nbsp;responsible for the creation of IT architectures, but with much assistance as defined above.&#xD;
    They must make the important decisions&amp;nbsp;needed to define the IT architecture, many of which will be documented in&#xD;
    Architectural Decisions.&amp;nbsp; In order for IT Architects to do their job they have to be very knowledgeable about IT&#xD;
    technologies of all descriptions as well as the business. However, they cannot know it all and have&amp;nbsp;to trust the&#xD;
    technology experts and business experts that help in decision making.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IT architects, at the enterprise, business line, business domain or any other level, are responsible for the definition&#xD;
    of:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architectural Decisions;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architecture Glossary;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business Perspectives;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Logical Perspectives;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical Perspectives;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Migration Plans.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are a number of other documents created during the development process, but these are the persisted and&#xD;
    maintained deliverables. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/roles/uam_enterprise_architect_D157E74C.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0yThIMIaEdyMpOiGFnM_WA&quot;>Role: Enterprise&#xD;
    Architect&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Support&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is a catch-all for people involved in supporting IT architects. They help maintain the deliverables and associated&#xD;
    repositories. They also assist in organizing meetings, documenting results, managing the necessary follow-up, and&#xD;
    keeping all architects informed of Architectural Decisions and other activities. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/roles/uam_support_F15F1622.html&quot; guid=&quot;_QR1yEMmzEdyU89e0dKAsrw&quot;>Role: Architecture Support&lt;/a>.&#xD;
