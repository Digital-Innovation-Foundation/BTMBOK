    theory, and self-determination theory.&lt;br />&#xD;

    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Bridget Anderson&lt;br />&#xD;
    Bridget Anderson thought life would be perfect out in the “real world.” After earning her degree in computer science,&#xD;
    she landed a well-paying job as a programmer for a large nonprofit organization whose mission she strongly believed in.&#xD;
    And—initially—she was happy with her job.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Lately however, Bridget gets a sick feeling in her stomach every morning when her alarm goes off. Why this feeling of&#xD;
    misery? After all, she’s working in her chosen field in an environment that matches her values. What else could she&#xD;
    want? She’s more puzzled than anyone.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It’s the end of her second year with the organization, and Bridget apprehensively schedules her annual performance&#xD;
    evaluation. She knows she’s a competent programmer, but she also knows that lately she’s been motivated to do only the&#xD;
    minimum required to get by. Her heart is just not in her work with this organization. Not exactly how she thought&#xD;
    things would turn out, that’s for sure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Bridget’s manager Kyle Jacobs surprises her when he begins the evaluation by inquiring about her professional goals.&#xD;
    She admits that she hasn’t thought much about her future. Kyle asks if she’s content in her current position and if she&#xD;
    feels that anything is missing. Suddenly, Bridget realizes that she does want more professionally.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Question: Are Bridget’s motivational problems intrinsic or extrinsic? Which of her needs are currently not being met?&#xD;
    What steps should she and her manager take to improve her motivation and ultimately her performance?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Outcome: Once Bridget admits that she’s unhappy with her position as a computer programmer, she’s ready to explore&#xD;
    other possibilities. She and Kyle brainstorm for tasks that will motivate her and bring her greater job satisfaction.&#xD;
    Bridget tells Kyle that while she enjoys programming, she feels isolated and misses interacting with other groups in&#xD;
    the organization. She also realizes that once she had mastered the initial learning curve, she felt bored. Bridget is&#xD;
    ready for a challenge.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Kyle recommends that Bridget move to an information systems team as their technical representative. The team can use&#xD;
    Bridget’s knowledge of programming, and Bridget will be able to collaborate more frequently with others in the&#xD;
    organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Bridget and Kyle set specific goals to satisfy her needs to achieve and to work collaboratively. One of Bridget’s goals&#xD;
    is to take graduate classes in management and information systems. She hopes that this will lead to an MBA and,&#xD;
    eventually, to a position as a team leader. Suddenly the prospect of going to work doesn’t seem so grim—and lately,&#xD;
    Bridget’s been beating her alarm!&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you’ve ever worked with a group of people, and we all have, you have no doubt noticed differences in their&#xD;
    performance. Researchers have pondered these differences for many years. Indeed, John B. Watson first studied this&#xD;
    issue in the early 1900s. Performance is, of course, an extremely important issue to employers because organizations&#xD;
    with high-performing employees will almost always be more effective.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To better understand why people perform at different levels, researchers consider the major determinants of&#xD;
    performance: ability, effort (motivation), accurate role perceptions, and environmental factors (see Exhibit 14.2).&#xD;
    Each performance determinant is important, and a deficit in one can seriously affect the others. People who don’t&#xD;
    understand what is expected of them will be constrained by their own inaccurate role perceptions, even if they have&#xD;
    strong abilities and motivation and the necessary resources to perform their job. None of the performance determinants&#xD;
    can compensate for a deficiency in any of the other determinants. Thus, a manager cannot compensate for an employee’s&#xD;
    lack of skills and ability by strengthening their motivation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
