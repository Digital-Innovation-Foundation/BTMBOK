    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Understand and describe the communication process.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Know the types of communications that occur in organizations.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Understand how power, status, purpose, and interpersonal skills affect communications in organizations.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe how corporate reputations are defined by how an organization communicates to all of its stakeholders.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Know why talking, listening, reading, and writing are vital to managing effectively.&lt;br />&#xD;
    We will distinguish between communication between two individuals and communication amongst several individuals&#xD;
    (groups) and communication outside the organization. We will show that managers spend a majority of their time in&#xD;
    communication with others. We will examine the reasons for communication and discuss the basic model of interpersonal&#xD;
    communication, the types of interpersonal communication, and major influences on the communication process. We will&#xD;
    also discuss how organizational reputation is defined by communication with stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    John Legere, T-Mobile&lt;br />&#xD;
    The chief executive officer is often the face of the company. He or she is often the North Star of the company,&#xD;
    providing guidance and direction for the entire organization. With other stakeholders, such as shareholders, suppliers,&#xD;
    regulatory agencies, and customers, CEOs often take more reserved and structured approaches. One CEO who definitely&#xD;
    stands out is John Legere, the CEO of T-Mobile. The unconventional CEO of the self-proclaimed “un-carrier” hosts a&#xD;
    Sunday morning podcast called “Slow Cooker Sunday” on Facebook Live, and where most CEOs appear on television&#xD;
    interviews in standard business attire, Legere appears with shoulder-length hair dressed in a magenta T-shirt, black&#xD;
    jacket, and pink sneakers. Whereas most CEOs use well-scripted language to address business issues and competitors,&#xD;
    Legere refers to T-Mobile’s largest competitors, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon, as “dumb and dumber.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the mobile phone market, T-Mobile is the number-three player competing with giants AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon and recently&#xD;
    came to an agreement to merge with Sprint. Of all the consolidation sweeping through the media and telecommunications&#xD;
    arena, T-Mobile and Sprint are the most direct of competitors. Their merger would reduce the number of national&#xD;
    wireless carriers from four to three, a move the Federal Communications Commission has firmly opposed in the past. Then&#xD;
    again, the wireless market looks a bit different now, as does the administration in power.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    John Legere and other CEOs such as Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, and Richard Branson have a more public profile than&#xD;
    executives at other companies that keep a lower profile and are more guarded in their public comments, often&#xD;
    restricting their public statements to quarterly investor and analyst meetings. It is likely that the personality and&#xD;
    communication style that the executives reveal in public is also the way that they relate to their employees. The&#xD;
    outgoing personality of someone such as John Legere will motivate some employees, but he might be seen as too much of a&#xD;
    cheerleader by other employees.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes the unscripted comments and colorful language that Legere uses can cause issues with employees and the&#xD;
    public. For instance, some T-Mobile employees in their call center admonished Legere for comments at a press event&#xD;
    where he said Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T were “raping” customers for every penny they have. Legere’s comments caused lengthy&#xD;
    discussions in online forums such as Reddit about his choice of words. Legere is known for speaking his mind in public&#xD;
    and often uses profanity, but many thought this comment crossed the line. While frank, open communication is often&#xD;
    appreciated and leads to a clarity of message, senders of communication, be it in a public forum, an internal memo, or&#xD;
    even a text message, should always think through the consequences of their words.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
