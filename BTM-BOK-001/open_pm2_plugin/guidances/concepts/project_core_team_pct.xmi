    The Project Core Team (PCT) comprises the specialist roles responsible for creating the project deliverables. Its
    composition and structure depend on the project size and type (e.g. IT project, policy development project, etc.) and
    is defined by the Project Manager (PM) based on the project’s needs.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

    roles that deserve to be discussed in more detail from a project management point of view: the Contractor’s Project
    Manager (CPM) and the Project Manager Assistant (PMA).
