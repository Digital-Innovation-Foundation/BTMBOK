    This section contains the information about the genesis of the PM²&amp;nbsp;Guide, the intended audience of this standard,
    what it provides to its users and how it helps organisations improve the management of their projects.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The PM² Guide is the creation of the European Commission by the Centre of Excellence in PM² (CoEPM²), its technical
    entity with expertise in the area of project management.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The PM² Guide was initially conceived as a standard to be used in the management of projects in public sector in the
    Eurpean Union's institutions but it can be used in any type of industry.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The PM² standard helps its users improve their project management by providing them with the knowledge&amp;nbsp;in relation
    to&amp;nbsp;the project governance structure, the project templates and a set of effective mindsets among others.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The PM² Guide can be customised by project practitioners when there is a need to adapt it to the project context but as
    a rule of thumb this customisation should be avoided or kept limited because this methodology was designed as an
    integrated whole.
