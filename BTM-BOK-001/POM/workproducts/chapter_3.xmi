    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Describe management in the ancient world.&lt;br />&#xD;
    How did the Italian Renaissance affect the progression of management theory?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How did the Industrial Revolution affect the progression of management theory?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How did Frederick Winslow Taylor influence management theory, and how did efficiency in management affect current&#xD;
    management theory?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do bureaucratic and administrative management complement scientific management?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How did Elton Mayo influence management theory, and how did the human relations movement affect current management&#xD;
    theory?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How did contingency and systems management transform management thought?&lt;br />&#xD;
    While you may think that management is a relatively new field, it actually has its roots in the ancient world. In fact,&#xD;
    whenever and wherever there has been commerce, there has been management and those thinking about how to do it better.&#xD;
    For example, the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, including the Colossus of Rhodes, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon,&#xD;
    and the Great Pyramid, could only have been constructed through the work of a great many people. The size and&#xD;
    complexity of these structures suggest that there must have been people (managers) who coordinated the labor and&#xD;
    resources needed to execute the construction plans. Similarly, the Romans and the ancient Chinese could not have&#xD;
    managed their vast empires without management, nor could the Phoenicians and the Greeks have dominated oceangoing trade&#xD;
    without management.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because management has been around for a while, it makes sense that the study of management is old. This idea is&#xD;
    supported by the many managerial insights we can find in political, diplomatic, and military history and in philosophy,&#xD;
    poetry, economics, and literature. Anyone familiar with Shakespeare’s King Lear would recognize the present-day&#xD;
    management problem of succession planning! Modern managers have been influenced by the works of Chinese military&#xD;
    strategist and philosopher Sun Tzu, Roman general and politician Julius Caesar, and even Genghis Kahn, Mongolian&#xD;
    conqueror and ruler of what became the largest land empire in all of history.1 Mark Zuckerberg2 of Facebook is a modern&#xD;
    admirer of the Caesars and has said that he bases some of his management style on his classical education.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Despite its ancient roots, modern management is less than 150 years old. In fact, a comparison of management before and&#xD;
    after the Industrial Revolution shows that the former is only a shadowy comparison to the latter. Prior to the&#xD;
    Industrial Revolution, work was performed, with exceptions, mostly in home and on farms by forced labor (slaves or&#xD;
    indentured servants) or family members, and the output they produced was often for employers’, local, or family&#xD;
    consumption. Over the centuries, economics and morality shifted, and laborers could choose where and for whom to work.&#xD;
    These changes, in turn, would bring about many changes in how labor and other resources were employed in production.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The two developments that transformed management were the revolutions in how and where goods were sold and the&#xD;
    Industrial Revolution. The events combined led to the selling of a wider variety of goods to a wider variety of&#xD;
    customers in more distant locations. These events also led to the establishment of vast companies. Competition required&#xD;
    the development of economies of scale (i.e., increased production lowering costs) and required coordination and&#xD;
    specialization in the use of resources. The combination of coordination and specialization problems encouraged the&#xD;
    development of management study as a distinct field.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this chapter, we trace the evaluation of management from its origins in the ancient world to its form as a modern&#xD;
    profession. Understanding how management came to be helps us to understand its principles in a richer, more thorough&#xD;
    context and to understand how each concept we discuss is based on evidence produced by a wide range of scholars over&#xD;
    many years in the fields of engineering, economics, psychology, sociology, and anthropology.&lt;br />&#xD;
    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Michael Porter: Harvard Professor and Management Consultant, The Monitor Group&lt;br />&#xD;
    Michael Porter is the Bishop William Lawrence University Professor at Harvard Business School and one of the foremost&#xD;
    scholars and consultants in business strategy. Dubbed the first “Lord of Strategy,” he is one of the most influential&#xD;
    management thinkers of all time. Porter’s primary contribution is in the field of competition, specifically the&#xD;
    question of why some companies profit while others do not. Porter first became interested in competition due to his&#xD;
    enthusiasm competing in youth sports (baseball, football, and basketball).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Porter was born in 1947 and graduated from Princeton in 1969 with a degree in aerospace and mechanical engineering. He&#xD;
    went on to receive his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1971 and his PhD in business economics from Harvard&#xD;
    University in 1973. His book Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors (published in&#xD;
    1980) was deemed the ninth most influential work of the 20th century by the Fellows of the Academy of Management.&#xD;
    Porter, writing during a period of great economic competition between the United States and Japan, was able to gain a&#xD;
    wide and vast audience for his work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In his 1979 Harvard Business Review article “How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy,” Porter presented his game&#xD;
    management idea that five forces help determine the level of profitability. The five forces are competition in the&#xD;
    industry, potential of new entrants into the industry, power of suppliers, power of customers, and threat of substitute&#xD;
    products. An unattractive industry is one in which the five forces align themselves to produce a purely competitive&#xD;
    industry. In this type of industry, normal profit levels are the highest a firm can expect, which means that the firm&#xD;
    can cover its costs and make the owner a profit but cannot make excess profits. Once a firm identifies the five forces&#xD;
    in its industry, it can choose between one of three generic strategies for success focus, differentiation, or cost&#xD;
    leadership. Depending on where a firm is positioned within the market, the marketplace will determine what strategy it&#xD;
    can take. This “five forces, three strategies” framework explains how McDonald’s, Morton’s Steakhouse, Subway, Wendy’s,&#xD;
    and TGIF can all be in the same industry and still be profitable. They offer different types of products to different&#xD;
    types of customers. These products compete on price, differentiation, focus, or a combination of these. In addition to&#xD;
    the five forces model, Porter developed the value-chain model, which describes the unique activities that a corporation&#xD;
    performs to make its products valuable to its customers. Porter has also contributed to health-care management,&#xD;
    environmental regulation, international competition, and industry-level profits.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Porter’s five forces framework is intuitive and has provided managers with an approach to develop actual strategies.&#xD;
    His ideas became popular because business leaders wanted to know how their companies could compete. Prior to Porter,&#xD;
    management scholars stressed the idiosyncratic nature of business, stressing how each situation faced by each business&#xD;
    was different. Other scholars offered business strategy models, but they were not as useful or practical as Porter’s.&#xD;
    Through his use of industrial-organizational economics and his training in the case method, Porter bridged the gap&#xD;
    between theoretical frameworks and the reality of the competitive business world and became one of the most important&#xD;
    thinkers on business in the world.&#xD;
