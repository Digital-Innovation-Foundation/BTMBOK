    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What is the benefit of working in teams, and what makes teams effective?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do teams develop over time?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are some key considerations in managing teams?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the benefits of conflict for a team?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How does team diversity enhance decision-making and problem-solving?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are some challenges and best practices for managing and working with multicultural teams?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Much of the work that is performed today in organizations requires a focus on teamwork. The ability to work&#xD;
    successfully as a team member, as well as the ability to lead teams, is an ultimate advantage within the workforce.&#xD;
    Teams themselves must be managed, in addition to managing just the individuals, to be successful. We’ve all heard the&#xD;
    quote originally coined by Aristotle that states that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” This captures&#xD;
    the nature of the team perfectly—there is such a synergy that comes from a team that the individuals alone are not able&#xD;
    to create. This chapter details the importance of and benefits that you may derive from working as a team, as well as&#xD;
    some of the ways we can make our teams more successful.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
