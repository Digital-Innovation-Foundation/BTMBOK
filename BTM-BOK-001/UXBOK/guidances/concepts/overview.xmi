&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Methods&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This section of the Usability BoK presents descriptions of methods, including procedures, resources needed, outcomes,&#xD;
    appropriate uses, benefits, and costs. These descriptions will form the core of a knowledge base that defines our field&#xD;
    and will help communicate usability methods to clients, project managers, and team members. Usability practitioners&#xD;
    will also benefit from cross-referencing of related methods and pointers to outside resources for more details.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Design&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This section of the Usability BoK presents patterns, principles, and guidelines on interaction design, information&#xD;
    design, graphical design, and interface design, which have evolved over time from foundations in HCI and other design&#xD;
    disciplines.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Managing UX&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As our profession has matured, we have developed common strategies and approaches for dealing with organizational&#xD;
    challenges, from marketing usability to integration with existing processes to managing a large and diverse usability&#xD;
    department. This section of the Usability BoK presents these practical guidelines using a &quot;Question and Answer&quot;&#xD;
    approach.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What is Usability?&lt;br />&#xD;
    A brief introduction to the subject of usability, how it relates to other User Experience disciplines, and how it&#xD;
    relates more broadly to other professional disciplines.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Glossary&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions of common terms related to usability and user-centered design. You may also note that certain words on this&#xD;
    site have a light underline. Hover over them - they allow you to see glossary definitions without leaving the page.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Who uses UXBOK?&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Usability BoK is targeted primarily to practitioners and educators, although it can also be used by managers,&#xD;
    decision makers, and others who interact with usability professionals or need information about usability.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Practitioners&lt;/strong> can use it to extend their skills, to find answers to questions, to get advice about&#xD;
        situations that they face in their work.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Educators&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>researchers&lt;/strong> can use it to prepare course materials, to structure a&#xD;
        curriculum for a course or degree program, and to find authoritative references.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Managers&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>decision makers&lt;/strong> can use it to understand the roles and skills of&#xD;
        usability professionals, to identify the benefits of incorporating usability at a project and an organizational&#xD;
        level, and to learn more about hiring employees or consultants.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Collaborators&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>colleagues&lt;/strong> such as developers, analysts, and other project team&#xD;
        members can use it to learn about usability and how it relates to their work.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Policymakers&lt;/strong>, ranging from standards bodies and other professional associations to government&#xD;
        legislators, can use it as a reference when setting standards or guidelines related to the use of technology.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Other interested people&lt;/strong>, which might include journalists, students, or people who are just curious&#xD;
        when they hear it mentioned, can get quick overviews on specific topics, as well as open up avenues to explore&#xD;
        further.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Other related sites&lt;/strong> (in future), via the Open Linked Data community, will be able to 'read' the&#xD;
        Usability BoK as a map of the overall subject of usability and user-centered design, allowing the information to be&#xD;
        linked to other information resources throughout the Web and the Semantic Web, as well as promoting the profession&#xD;
        to other communities. This means that related disciplines who are also working on their own web resources and&#xD;
        Bodies of Knowledge (such as STC, IxDA, etc.) can inter-link and share content, as well as potentially move toward&#xD;
        cross-searching information from multiple related sites.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
