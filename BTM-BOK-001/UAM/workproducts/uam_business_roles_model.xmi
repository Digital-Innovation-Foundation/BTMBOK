  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Business Roles Model is created (at least a subset) very early during the architecture development, and fully&#xD;
    detailed and adjusted as the architecture progresses. This artifact is enclosed within the Business Perspective&#xD;
    artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Business_Perspective__Business_Roles_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Business_Perspective__Business_Roles_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Roles Model is a way of expressing the Business Activities&amp;nbsp;interacted with by&amp;nbsp;Actors. Actors are&#xD;
    conceptual at the highest level. The types of Actors and interactions they have with Business Activities are what are&#xD;
    modeled. Business Activities in this context equate to &quot;business interactions&quot;, which will be detailed more at the&#xD;
    Logical and Technical levels. Note that only Actors are defined at the Business level since defining Roles requires&#xD;
    that a &quot;automate&quot; vs. &quot;manual&quot; decision to be made, which is not done at the Business level; this is left to the&#xD;
    Logical level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (and the user level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, but only starting at the Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information&#xD;
    / services may be controlled based upon a user's Role). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Business Actors and&#xD;
    the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process analysts&#xD;
    and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by systems&#xD;
    analysts and software architects to provide context for software development.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Roles Model defines the high-level Business Actors involved in the system, as defined by the scope of the&#xD;
    modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define the Business Actors involved, and the sorts of interactions they&#xD;
    have with the&amp;nbsp;system.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Failure to produce this model means you run the risk that architects and designers will give only superficial attention&#xD;
    to the way the business operates. They will do what they know best, which is to design and build systems in the absence&#xD;
    of proper business knowledge. The result often is that the constructed systems do not support the need of the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>UML Representation&lt;/strong>: Package stereotyped as «BPL_BRM» containing class diagrams.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A &lt;strong>Business Roles Model&lt;/strong> may have the following properties:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Introduction:&lt;/strong> A textual description that serves as a brief introduction to the model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Packages:&lt;/strong> The packages in the model, representing a hierarchy.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Role&lt;/strong>: The Roles in the model, owned by the packages stereotyped as&amp;nbsp;«BPL_Role».&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Actor:&lt;/strong> The Actors in the model, owned by the packages stereotyped as&amp;nbsp;«BPL_Actor».&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Relationships:&lt;/strong> The relationships in the model, owned by the packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Diagrams:&lt;/strong> The diagrams in the model, owned by the packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is business process re-engineering the target organization, you should&#xD;
    consider maintaining two variants of the Business Roles Model: one that shows the business actors and business&#xD;
    activities of the current organization (sometimes called &quot;as-is&quot;), and one that shows the target organization with new&#xD;
    business actors and business activities (&quot;to-be&quot;). This separation is needed when doing business process&#xD;
    re-engineering, otherwise the redesign will be developed without knowing what the proposed changes really are at the&#xD;
    end, and you will not be able to estimate the costs of those changes.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The cost of maintaining two Business Roles Models is not insignificant, and you should carefully consider how much&#xD;
    effort you put into a current model. Typically, you would not do more than identify and briefly describe the business&#xD;
    activities and business actors. You would also briefly outline the business activities you determine are key to the&#xD;
    effort, possibly illustrating this with a simple activity diagram. The level of detail you choose should aim at&#xD;
    providing a shared understanding of the target organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You would not need this separation if:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        There is no &quot;new&quot; organization (the goal is to document an existing organization);&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        There is no existing organization (i.e. a &quot;green field&quot;).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></representationOptions>
