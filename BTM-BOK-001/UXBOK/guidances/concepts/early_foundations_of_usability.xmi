    In 1857, having observed the beginnings of work adaptations in industry, the Polish scientist Wojciech Jastrzebowski&#xD;
    provided the first known use of the term &quot;ergonomics&quot;, derived from Greek roots meaning &quot;the laws of work.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    In about the 1920s, work such as Frank and Lillian Gilbreth's &quot;time motion studies,&quot; popularly known as &quot;efficiency&#xD;
    studies,&quot; emerged, moving this science into a visible and practical realm. The Gilbreths' efforts focused primarily on&#xD;
    adapting human activities and processes to the work, with Lillian Gilbreth later making significant inroads for General&#xD;
    Electric into more efficient designs for kitchens and household appliances. The concept of efficient design developed&#xD;
    into a profession in the 1950s, in part with the support of the United States Department of Defense. As the field&#xD;
    matured, it split into two areas of knowledge and approach:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;strong>Cognitive ergonomics&lt;/strong>, covering human behavior and attributes such as decision making process,&#xD;
            organization design, human perception relative to design&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;strong>Industrial ergonomics&lt;/strong>, covering the physical interactions of humans and workplace design, such&#xD;
            as human ranges of strength for lifting, tolerance of repetitive movement both for the sake of efficiency of&#xD;
            work and safety of workers, and length of reach of the human arm for best design with respect to where&#xD;
            equipment elements were placed and human movements performed.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    In the 1940s, engineering psychology emerged as a separate discipline, the initial focus of which was post-World War II&#xD;
    aviation human factors. The field was solidified by the publication of the textbook Applied Experimental Psychology&#xD;
    based on lectures presented in preceding years at the Naval Postgraduate School. This marked the continuing, intense&#xD;
    application of cognitive psychology to aviation human factors, focusing not only on flight displays and the ergonomics&#xD;
    sometimes called &quot;knob-ology,&quot; but also on flight missions, control principles, and the measurement of pilot behavior.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Driven by war casualties that were identified as being caused by &quot;human error,&quot; the United States Department of Defense&#xD;
    began funding efforts to account for human error in aviation design and implementation. This type of cognitive design&#xD;
    made its way into general product design, and the field of human factors psychology, alternately known as engineering&#xD;
    psychology or applied experimental psychology, took root as central to creating tools with which humans would interact.&#xD;
