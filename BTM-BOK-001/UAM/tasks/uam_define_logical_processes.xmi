  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task defines, at the logical level, the processes involved in the architecture in question. Also, and very&#xD;
    important, is the definition of standard business vocabulary that is used to describe and discuss the business and the&#xD;
    solution. Also added at the logical level are the roles associated with the activities and tasks that define the&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Process Model is used along with input from stakeholders to define and refine the Logical Process Model.&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_aIO8AMOrEdyILM4NThxMFg&quot;>Artifact: Business Process Model&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;conceptually defines the processes within the&#xD;
    system and the contained tasks and activities. Now this conceptual view is further analyzed and a logical view created.&#xD;
    We are creating a model&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;logical level (see:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../UAM/guidances/concepts/uam_levels_and_views_499BC4B8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_W4UEAMqpEdy25fQyv59CjQ&quot;>Concept:&#xD;
    Architecture Perspectives and Viewpoints&lt;/a>) with a focus on the &lt;em>tasks&lt;/em> and &lt;em>activities&lt;/em> and how&#xD;
    they&amp;nbsp;define the business processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Processes are driven by events that the system must deal with. Look at these events and the processes that they&#xD;
    trigger. Identify the activities and processes and their sequence as the event is responded to, and model the&#xD;
    interactions between them and their inputs and outputs (in terms of&amp;nbsp;logical entities).&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The term organization in this context has nothing to do with the management structure of the system or enterprise. It&#xD;
    is the organization of the identified tasks and processes based upon cohesiveness and other grouping criteria. It is&#xD;
    expected for example that HR or Financial activities and processes would have high-coupling, and are therefore grouped&#xD;
    under their respective domains or sub-domains. In effect what we are doing is double checking the business level model&#xD;
    of the system's processes and activities, since the organization at the logical level should be directly reflected in&#xD;
    the structure at the business level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Other structures may be discovered, for example when the high-level business activities are decomposed into more&#xD;
    detail, there may be sub-processes (or tasks) that are closely related.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Many business level activities, when decomposed into more detailed logical level activities, may have activities in common,&#xD;
or even sub-processes in common. It may not be obvious, due to the vagarities of names and descriptions, therefore it is&#xD;
useful to have a look at the completed model from this perspective. Focusing on input and output artifacts is a useful&#xD;
approach.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>As an aid in the development of the Logical Locations Model, look for location dependencies within the tasks and processes.&#xD;
An &quot;ATM&quot; service for example needs to be deployed to a location of use to the customer. Define these locations and the&#xD;
activities supported at them. Consulting the Locations model is also useful in that processes may span locations, which&#xD;
needs to be understood if they are to be properly supported and function correctly.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Validate the interactions between activities, and the inputs and outputs of the activities (in terms of&amp;nbsp;logical&#xD;
    entities), to ensure consistency with the Logical Data Model and Logical Roles Model. Process walk-throughs are a very&#xD;
    good way to do this.&#xD;

  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task finds and defines the activities (namely processes and tasks) involved in the architecture in question.&#xD;
    Specifically to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define or refine the logical level activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define or refine the logical level processes; the relationships that need to be supported between tasks;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Optionally define or refine the important logical level&amp;nbsp;entities involved with the tasks and processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
