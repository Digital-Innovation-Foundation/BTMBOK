    Following each review meeting, the results of the meeting should be documented in some form of &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../UAM/workproducts/uam_review_record_B5C8210C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_ON-wgPIOEdyIELoltz1wKA&quot;>Artifact: Architecture Review Record&lt;/a>. In addition, change requests are formally&#xD;
    recorded and assigned to someone to own and drive to resolution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the most important yet surprisingly often neglected aspects of reviews is the management to resolution of the&#xD;
    follow-up tasks or actions identified during the review. While you can usually resolve many of the identified&#xD;
    issues&amp;nbsp;during the course of the review meeting itself, be prepared to assign tasks as needed but ensure that the&#xD;
    workload of team members is balanced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that even if you can review everything you need to in a single meeting, you probably won't get approval of all&#xD;
    your conclusions the first time. Be prepared to carry out subsequent reviews as necessary to help manage the&#xD;
    undertaking of a large number of follow-up tasks.&#xD;

    The following updates may be done for each review record action:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Mark as completed;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Update the status and the description of the action if needed;&#xD;

        Escalate the issue or action, to the project manager or higher, if needed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architecture perspective review / analysis is not complete until all actions are marked as completed.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    The review record is re-published once all updates are done.&#xD;

  <purpose>An architectural &lt;em>review&lt;/em> is carried out&amp;nbsp;to ensure that the perspective models are complete and well-defined,&#xD;
and to ensure that the system is accurately captured in the models.&amp;nbsp;An architecture &lt;em>analysis&lt;/em> takes a step&#xD;
back from the IT architecture and looks at the larger context, proposed solutions, implications of these solutions, and how&#xD;
it all fits into the enterprise's business strategy, IT strategy, technology and other standards,&amp;nbsp;and other plans and&#xD;
objectives. This analysis is slightly different for each of the levels. Not only are the participants different, the focus&#xD;
and objectives of the analysis at the Business level are much different that those at the Technical level</purpose>
