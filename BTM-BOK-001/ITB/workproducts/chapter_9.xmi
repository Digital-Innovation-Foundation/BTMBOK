    Motivating Employees&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What are the basic principles of Frederick Taylor’s concept of scientific management?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What did Elton Mayo’s Hawthorne studies reveal about worker motivation?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What is Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and how do these needs relate to employee motivation?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How are McGregor’s Theories X and Y and Ouchi’s Theory Z used to explain worker motivation?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the basic components of Herzberg’s motivator-hygiene theory?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What four contemporary theories on employee motivation offer insights into improving employee performance?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How can managers redesign existing jobs to increase employee motivation and performance?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What initiatives are organizations using today to motivate and retain employees?&lt;br />&#xD;
    This chapter details motivational theory, both historically and currently, and applies that theory to the business&#xD;
    world, where motivation, whether in the form of a rock band or not, is a key to success.&lt;br />&#xD;
    People can be a firm’s most important resource. They can also be the most challenging resource to manage well.&#xD;
    Employees who are motivated and work hard to achieve personal and organizational goals can become a crucial competitive&#xD;
    advantage for a firm. The key then is understanding the process of motivation, what motivates individuals, and how an&#xD;
    organization can create a workplace that allows people to perform to the best of their abilities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Chuck Kaplan, Ciena Corporation&lt;br />&#xD;
    Chuck Kaplan loves music and playing in a band, but he does not work in the music industry. He works for Ciena&#xD;
    Corporation, a global supplier of telecommunications networking equipment, software, and services. Kaplan spends his&#xD;
    days leading a team to help customers solve business problems by updating and creating revenue through their&#xD;
    networks—the process of modernizing and monetizing networks. He also plays music with OTN Speedwagon, Ciena’s&#xD;
    all-employee band.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    OTN Speedwagon was created after Kaplan thought the entertainment at a corporate function was “cheesy.” He and three&#xD;
    others took the idea of creating an employee band to their boss, and OTN Speedwagon was born. Its name comes from the&#xD;
    networking technology Ciena implements, Optical Transport Network, and the rock band REO Speedwagon; its members are&#xD;
    from all over the globe.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The band is made up of employees from multiple departments, time zones, and countries. Members include an executive&#xD;
    administrative assistant in London, England; a CTO in Dallas, Texas; sales system engineers in Dallas, Texas, and St.&#xD;
    Louis, Missouri; an account manager in Denver, Colorado; senior managers in Baltimore, Maryland, and New York, New&#xD;
    York; a sales consultant in Atlanta, Georgia; vice presidents in Atlanta, Georgia, and Dallas, Texas; and a materials&#xD;
    management leader in Ottawa, Canada. When playing with the band, they set aside their job titles and focus on producing&#xD;
    award-winning music.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    OTN Speedwagon performs songs in a variety of styles and enjoys performing whenever and wherever opportunity exists. A&#xD;
    highlight is the opportunity to compete at the Fortune Battle of the Corporate Band, a competition for all-employee&#xD;
    bands. OTN Speedwagon won the event one year, beating seven other corporate bands. Two members also walked away with&#xD;
    individual awards: best guitarist and best horns.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Producing great music together is not easy. Everyone knows one person being off-tempo or off-key can ruin a song.&#xD;
    Because the band members have different job responsibilities and live in separate countries, they are rarely together.&#xD;
    Scheduling live rehearsals is a major challenge, and they often happen only the day of or day before an event. The band&#xD;
    is up to the challenge, though, and harnesses technology to solve the problem. The members discuss songs to sing&#xD;
    (enough for a multi-hour show!) and pick a key for each song that fits the lead vocalist. One member makes an MP3&#xD;
    soundtrack for each song and shares it and lyrics with the others through a secure file-sharing system. Everyone spends&#xD;
    hours practicing to the soundtracks—alone. But hard work and dedication pay off. When the band finally is together,&#xD;
    often one time through is enough to perfect each song.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Opportunities and benefits such as being part of the band pay dividends for Ciena, certified as a “great place to&#xD;
    work.” Band members say trust in each other to do each person’s part makes the band a success. Everyone knows what to&#xD;
    do and does it, and that level of trust transfers back to the workplace. Members have built trust in coworkers, knocked&#xD;
    down walls, and become more collaborative. The experience has brought the employees together, some meeting for the&#xD;
    first time at rehearsal, and made the company seem more like a family. Bonus benefit? Corporate events are much more&#xD;
    entertaining.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
