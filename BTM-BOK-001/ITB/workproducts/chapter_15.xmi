    Undestanding Money and Financial Institutions&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What is money, what are its characteristics and functions, and what are the three parts of the U.S. money supply?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How does the Federal Reserve manage the money supply?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the key financial institutions, and what role do they play in the process of financial intermediation?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How does the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) protect depositors’ funds?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What roles do U.S. banks play in the international marketplace?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What trends are reshaping financial institutions?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Advanced technology, globalization of markets, and the relaxation of regulatory restrictions continue to accelerate the&#xD;
    pace of change in the financial services industry. These changes are giving businesses and consumers new options for&#xD;
    conducting their financial transactions. The competitive landscape for financial institutions is also changing,&#xD;
    creating new ways for these firms to increase their market share and boost profits.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This chapter focuses on the role of financial institutions in U.S. and international economies. It discusses different&#xD;
    types of financial institutions, how they are set up and how they function internally, and government oversight of&#xD;
    their operations. Because financial institutions connect people with money, this chapter begins with a discussion of&#xD;
    money, its characteristics and functions, and the components of the U.S. money supply. Next, it explains the role of&#xD;
    the Federal Reserve System in managing the money supply. Then it describes different types of financial institutions&#xD;
    and their services and the organizations that insure customer deposits. The chapter ends with a discussion of&#xD;
    international banking and trends in financial institutions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Michelle Moore&lt;br />&#xD;
    Bank of America&lt;br />&#xD;
    Technology continues to change every facet of daily life, including how consumers interact with banks and other&#xD;
    financial institutions. Whether large or small, banks have to stay one step ahead of the competition when it comes to&#xD;
    providing top-notch service to their customers, including digital and mobile channels. Michelle Moore, head of digital&#xD;
    banking at Bank of America, has worked in various parts of the company for more than 14 years. Regardless of her role&#xD;
    within the organization, Moore has consistently demonstrated her obsession with exceptional service and how best to&#xD;
    make sure the bank is providing customers with products and features that will make their lives easier, keep them loyal&#xD;
    to the organization, and ultimately increase sales.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While overseeing the bank’s call center operations, Moore was asked to take on the bank’s mobile initiatives, a request&#xD;
    that befuddled her. Moore is the first to tell you she is no techy—she admits she kept her beloved flip phone too long&#xD;
    before opting for a smartphone. Yet, her people skills and her drive to provide the best customer service made her the&#xD;
    perfect person to take on the bank’s digital and mobile efforts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Like other major financial institutions, Bank of America did not have a stellar reputation when it came to digital or&#xD;
    mobile banking. Although customers used the bank’s digital offerings, the services were basic, even as the smartphone&#xD;
    revolution changed many of life’s daily activities. Once Moore and her digital team got the bank’s mobile app up to&#xD;
    speed, they began to figure out how to make it better. The team started to add features to the app, making sure that&#xD;
    nearly everything customers can do at a bank branch they can do on the new and improved app. In addition, Moore and her&#xD;
    group created a digital assistant feature that uses artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to provide&#xD;
    customers with the same level of advice and expertise that previously would have been reserved for customers with&#xD;
    high-end wealth-management accounts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A play on the word “America,” the app called Erica recently debuted to the public, and customer reaction has been&#xD;
    positive. But Moore is never satisfied with the status quo. She encourages her team to constantly ask how customers&#xD;
    will use the app and what will it take to make and keep them happy with the digital assistant’s features. For example,&#xD;
    after Moore read an article on the success of Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa, she wondered, “Why can’t our banking app&#xD;
    talk to clients?” She pushed her team to add a voice feature to Erica, which gives the digital assistant a competitive&#xD;
    edge over other banking mobile apps for now.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Moore knows that customer sentiment is critical to the bank’s success, especially in mobile banking. She continues to&#xD;
    be obsessed by customer reviews and how the bank can increase customer satisfaction quickly and efficiently, and she&#xD;
    knows that agility is critical in an ever-changing bank environment. Her efforts are paying off. Several years ago,&#xD;
    Bank of America had 6 million mobile banking users; today, that number has jumped to more than 22 million. In a recent&#xD;
    three-month period, mobile banking customers logged in to their accounts more than 967 million times—more than double&#xD;
    the number of desktop logins. And when customers need to visit a local bank branch, more and more of them are booking&#xD;
    appointments via the mobile app each week. Although she knows there is more work to do, Moore’s common-sense approach&#xD;
    to listening to customers while leveraging technology will help Bank of America increase sales and stay ahead of the&#xD;
    competition.&#xD;
