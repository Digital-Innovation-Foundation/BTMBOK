&lt;p>&#xD;
    The difference between a business process and a business function must be well understood, along with how they relate&#xD;
    to each other.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This distinction is important when defining architectures and specifically the process models. As hinted at above a&#xD;
    business function provides functionality that is useful for one or more business processes—it is the vertical view of&#xD;
    the business (e.g. Customer Relations or Financial Services). A business process on the other hand is a horizontal view&#xD;
    of the business that at a high-level equate to business services offered to customers (e.g. Order Processing or Travel&#xD;
    Booking). This distinction is not always clear, especially at lower levels within an enterprise, but when modeling at&#xD;
    the Business level it is important. These concepts are illustrated in the figure below, which is well understood by&#xD;
    Business Analysis’s and definitely needs to be understood by IT architects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As can be noted in the diagram, Business Processes implement or provide the Business Services to customers/users and&#xD;
    cut across functional boundaries within the enterprise.&#xD;
