    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A primary purpose of modeling business&amp;nbsp;actors is to describe how the business activities are interacted with by&#xD;
    various internal and external actors, and most&amp;nbsp;importantly by&amp;nbsp;its customers and partners. All interactions of&#xD;
    actors&amp;nbsp;with business activities are defined. Employees that interact with business activities and process are also&#xD;
    modeled as actors. &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>&lt;u>Note&lt;/u>:&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;Roles are &lt;em>&lt;strong>not&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> defined at the business level—they are&#xD;
        define in the Logical Perspective. This is because roles imply a decision regarding the implementation of the&#xD;
        associated activity (i.e., manual, user, or automated). These decisions are &lt;em>only&lt;/em> made at the Logical&#xD;
        level. Therefore only Actors are defined, but roles defined at the Logical level may be added to the Business Roles&#xD;
        Model if desired.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to the diagrams described below, at the business level a context diagram is defined. This diagram is very&#xD;
    useful in not only understanding the scope and context of the system but also in identifying the associated Actors. The&#xD;
    example below defines the context for ThuNorTech, the fictional company in the UAM example architecture. The outermost&#xD;
    'square' defines the ThuNorTech Domain, with the various Actors and their interactions&amp;nbsp;defined.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;

    height=&quot;265&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Diagrams used in the Business Roles Model are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Roles Summary Diagram&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Roles in Context Diagrams&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Roles Summary Diagram&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A roles summary diagram is used in the Business Roles Model to detail the structure of Actors and also of Roles. It&#xD;
    also shows the relationships between Actors/Roles and business activities. At the business level it is quite simple,&#xD;
    with much more analysis and detail being defined at the logical level where the roles are actually defined:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Business roles use-case model&quot; src=&quot;./resources/BL-Business-BRM-IT-Research.png&quot; />&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This may be redundant if the system is simple, since this roles information&amp;nbsp;may be shown on the&amp;nbsp;Business&#xD;
    Process Model, however, in a complex system it is useful to document additional GUI/Interface details in this diagram,&#xD;
    particularly at the logical and technical levels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Roles in Context Diagrams&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A &quot;roles-in-context&quot; diagram is used in the Business Roles Model to detail the interactions of roles/actors with the&#xD;
    activities in the system. Note that roles are defined at the logical level, but may be rolled up to the Business&#xD;
    Perspective. This example diagram is similar to the one above, but is a simplified version showing only the relevant&#xD;
    activities and with extraneous information removed:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Structure of roles within the enterprise&quot; src=&quot;./resources/BL-Business-BRM-Research.png&quot; />&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is one of these diagrams for each process defined within the system. Note that since roles are defined at the&#xD;
    logical level, not all &quot;roles-in-context&quot; diagrams will be defined at the business level—only those important when&#xD;
    briefing stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Layering the roles model (to deal with complexity)&amp;nbsp;isn't as convenient as with other types of diagrams, but can&#xD;
    also be of value. Start with a top layer of roles that are abstractions of all the enterprise 'actors' and activities&#xD;
    representing the presentation layer that they interact with, with the next layer of detail showing roles structures&#xD;
    (and more presentation layer detail).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3 align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Focus of Business Roles Model&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Unified Architecture Method (UAM),&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the business roles model,&amp;nbsp;the activities do not represent&#xD;
    the complete business activity, just the presentation layer or interface. These activities therefore represent the&#xD;
    boundary portion of the Business Process Model. In other words, the Business Process Model captures all of the business&#xD;
    processes, activities and tasks, but&amp;nbsp;with the interface/GUI portion also being represented in the Business Roles&#xD;
    Model. The Business Roles Model is complete, but the two models together define the complete business solution. If the&#xD;
    system is simple, with few roles and little structure to the roles then just use&amp;nbsp;a Business Process Model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is a useful construct for complex systems since separation out of the GUI/interface early in the definition of the&#xD;
    architecture will result in a more flexible design and implementation that better serves the business and the actors.&#xD;
    The roles model is also used to analyze the structure of roles, since there usually is much duplication and overlap&#xD;
    between roles in early iterations. Clearer separation of roles and identification of role structure will aid greatly in&#xD;
    developing a logical design and technical model that will be effective, flexible and economical.&amp;nbsp;The same holds&#xD;
    true for the analysis of actors. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_aVWS0OSYEdy7f9KmjDtwsA&quot;>Guideline: Business Perspective Views&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The detail and structure of the overall solution will be made apparent as the views of the enterprise architecture are&#xD;
    developed and layers added within views. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/concepts/uam_levels_and_views_499BC4B8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_W4UEAMqpEdy25fQyv59CjQ&quot;>Concept:&#xD;

    Complex IT Architectures&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>&lt;u>Note&lt;/u>:&lt;/strong> Since UAM may model a complete enterprise (or business domain), the level of detail&#xD;
        to be included in this model is a judgment call of the architect, based upon:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN-LEFT: 2em&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The objective of the architecture effort;&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The size of the enterprise or (business line);&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Time and resource constraints.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/div>&#xD;
