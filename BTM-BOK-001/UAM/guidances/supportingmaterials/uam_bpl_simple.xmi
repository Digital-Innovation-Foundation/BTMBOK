&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Business Perspective Overview&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Perspective Language is based upon a very small subset of BPMN elements, with the addition of business&#xD;
    entities, business locations, and business roles elements. The image below summarizes, using UML notation, the language&#xD;
    elements and inter-relationships of the UAM Business Perspective language.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;UAM Business Perspective Language Summary&quot; src=&quot;./resources/BPM-Summary.png&quot; />&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This metamodel summarizes the Business Perspective language.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Business Entity Viewpoint&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Entity Model defines the high-level business entities involved in the enterprise or system, as defined by&#xD;
    the scope of the modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define the business entities involved, and the&#xD;
    relationships between them. The definition must be valid for the defined scope, and must eliminate any ambiguity&#xD;
    regarding what they represent.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Relationships between entities are derived directly from analysis of the business, its functions and processes. Two&#xD;
    main aspects are important, the relationships supporting the business processes and functions, and the relationships&#xD;
    supporting the monitoring and management of the business. Note that generalizations, aggregations and other types of&#xD;
    analysis are not done, and shouldn't be required when working at this conceptual level of analysis. Only simple&#xD;
    associations are modeled, and the modeling is done and definitions derived at the business level using business&#xD;
    terminology.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;UAM Business Entity Model viewpoint language&quot; src=&quot;./resources/BEM.png&quot; />&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business actors that work with these entities are also identified. This is simply a start at identifying these&#xD;
    important relationships. The majority of the analysis will take place at the logical level where the structure of&#xD;
    actors and roles is defined and refined, along with their relationships to business entities, to identify the access&#xD;
    controls aspect of IT security required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Business Process Viewpoint&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Process viewpoint defines the high-level business activities and processes involved in the enterprise or&#xD;
    system, as defined by the scope of the modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define the business processes&#xD;
    involved. The definition must be valid for the defined scope, and must eliminate any ambiguity regarding what they&#xD;
    represent.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The workflow of a business activity describes what the business must do to provide the value the served business role&#xD;
    requires. A business process consists of a sequence of activities that, together, produce something of value for the&#xD;
    business (role and associated actor). The workflow often consists of a basic flow and one or more alternative flows.&#xD;
    The structure of the workflow is described graphically with the help of process diagrams. In summary, a business&#xD;
    process is a sequence of activities that, together, produce something of value for the business role. Activities may&#xD;
    have hierarchical structure defined in order to capture the level of detail required by the context and objective of&#xD;
    the architecture effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;UAM Business Process Viewpoint Language&quot; src=&quot;./resources/BPM.png&quot; />&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Optionally, relationships between Business Activities and Business Entities may be defined-namely, the Business&#xD;
    Entities created, read, updated or deleted (CRUD) by the Activity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Business Locations Viewpoint&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Location Model defines the high-level business locations involved in the enterprise or system, as defined&#xD;
    by the scope of the modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define at the conceptual level the business locations&#xD;
    involved, and the sorts of services provided within and between them. This information is important (in the long term)&#xD;
    in deciding on the architecture for applications and services, so that they operate effectively over a slow speed WAN&#xD;
    for example (i.e. addressing non-functional requirements). Security implications and requirements are also derived from&#xD;
    this model, for example at this conceptual level some of these defined logical &quot;locations&quot; may include security domains&#xD;
    and zones; however the full definition of required domains and zones is done at the logical level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;UAM Business Locations Model viewpoint language&quot; src=&quot;./resources/BLM.png&quot; />&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to clearly define the business locations and the relationships between them in terms of the services&#xD;
    (activities and workflows) provided and notionally the services provided (data, voice, etc.) between them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Business Roles Viewpoint&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Roles Model defines the high-level Business Actors and Roles involved in the enterprise or system, as&#xD;
    defined by the scope of the modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define the Business Actors and Roles involved,&#xD;
    and the sorts of interactions they have with the system. This information is important in deciding on the presentation&#xD;
    architecture activities and services, so that usability concerns, integration concerns (at the user level) and other&#xD;
    issues are understood. Security implications are also derived from this model-for example, access to information and&#xD;
    services may be controlled based upon a user's role (e.g. Analyst vs. reporter vs. editor roles within a newspaper for&#xD;
    example).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;img alt=&quot;UAM Business Roles Model viewpoint language&quot; src=&quot;./resources/BRM.png&quot; />&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to clearly define the business roles and the interactions that they have with the system. This&#xD;
    information is used by stakeholders, business-process analysts and business designers to understand and improve the way&#xD;
    the business interacts with its environment, and by systems analysts and software architects to provide context and&#xD;
    requirements for software development specifically the interface to activities and tasks (i.e. Graphical User&#xD;
    Interfaces (GUI), etc.).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It should be noted (as shown in the figure) that there can be multiple roles associated with a Business Activity and&#xD;
    that each of these roles may have some specialization defined. This enables the capturing of multiple ways of&#xD;
    interacting with the system for a given set of business activities and functions. The high-level conceptual perspective&#xD;
    that one typically works at (at least initially) when developing the business views demands that the language supports&#xD;
    this ability.&#xD;
