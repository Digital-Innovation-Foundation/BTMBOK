    Digital alignment is an outcome of the improvement of people, process and technology. Digital alignment mainly focuses&#xD;
    on the maturity of digital transformation, both internally and externally, with employees and customers. Internally it&#xD;
    affects how employees benefit from digital products and endpoints, such as APIs, events and streams, to increase their&#xD;
    productivity and improve their decision-making process. Externally, it affects the experiences that customers and&#xD;
    partners have with the digital products and endpoints focused on enabling an external transformation. In the current&#xD;
    digital era, consumers are looking for a real-time, personalized, geo-sensitive and predictive experience from the&#xD;
    products and the services they use.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Together, &lt;strong>culture&lt;/strong> and the &lt;strong>architecture&lt;/strong> create a platform for enabling people,&#xD;
    process, and technology to operate and improve. Culture plays the primary role in supporting people while architecture&#xD;
    has the primary role in supporting technology. However, both of these foundations have overlapping and complementary&#xD;
    roles in supporting all three pillars of digital alignment: people, process, and technology.&#xD;
