    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Chieh Huang, Boxed&lt;br />&#xD;
    As a successful entrepreneur, Chieh Huang knows how spot a business opportunity. His current business venture, Boxed,&#xD;
    ships warehouse-club type products directly to customers’ homes. The company has grown from $8 million in revenue to&#xD;
    more than $100 million in just three years. How has Huang achieved this success? He started “basically trying to solve&#xD;
    a problem that I myself have. I grew up in the burbs, and every other weekend would go to the Price Club, and then I&#xD;
    went to the city and didn’t have a car anymore. Am I just supposed to get ripped off?”1 Huang thought that other&#xD;
    millennials might be in the same situation and developed a company to offer bulk items like paper towels and energy&#xD;
    bars at warehouse-club prices to millennials who want app-based shopping convenience.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Huang explained his entrepreneurial approach this way: “With repeat entrepreneurs, you not only solve a problem, you&#xD;
    look for changes taking place in the world that become tailwinds to help the business exponentially grow.”2&#xD;
    Environmental analysis might reveal an opportunity, but strategic planning is what makes it grow. Huang has managed&#xD;
    growth by obtaining the resources necessary to serve more customers. As CEO of Boxed, Huang has raised money to build&#xD;
    distribution centers, hired employees, developed private-label products to offer customers low prices, and expanded&#xD;
    supplier relationships.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What is the strategy at Boxed? Huang discussed the company’s position in an interview on CNBC. He acknowledged that&#xD;
    today’s selling environment is focused on “value, convenience, and brand,”3 and said that when companies sell at&#xD;
    similar low prices and offer similar delivery services, the only real differentiator left is brand. Huang has worked&#xD;
    hard to develop the Boxed brand, promoting it on CNN, MSNBC, and the Today Show. The Boxed brand is also enhanced by&#xD;
    reports of the benefits Huang offers employees. The CEO pays college tuition for employees’ children and even pays for&#xD;
    employee weddings. For millennials, a company’s values have become part of its value, and if the price and convenience&#xD;
    offered by Boxed match other sellers, Boxed’s values may be their best asset in attracting customers. This YouTube&#xD;
    video is a CNBC story about Boxed with an interview with Huang.&#xD;
