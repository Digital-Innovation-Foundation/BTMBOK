    Developing the team is part of executing the project. The project manager is responsible for improving the interaction&#xD;
    of team members and the trust among the team, incorporating team building into project activities and empowering the&#xD;
    team to make decisions. Management is done by objectives and not by time reporting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project manager helps the team to meet the iteration objectives by removing constraints and monitoring the progress&#xD;
    and work remaining to completion. When the team is falling behind,&amp;nbsp;the project&amp;nbsp;manager&amp;nbsp;helps the team to&#xD;
    assess how it can reduce work and still meet the iteration goals. Stakeholders' needs must be continuously met and&#xD;
    their issues resolved throughout the iteration. The stakeholders may need to be involved in approving changes and&#xD;
    actions that affect them.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Continuously monitor the iteration to ensure that it is progressing appropriately. Track the progress of the current&#xD;
    iteration by maintaining visibility on the status of the items that are being worked on during the iteration. In&#xD;
    particular, it is important to be able to understand how quickly the team is moving through the work scheduled for the&#xD;
    iteration, and how accurate the estimates were &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Share information about the progress being made by having quick, frequent meetings with the entire project team. These&#xD;
    meetings are useful to understand what team members have accomplished since the last meeting, and what they plan to&#xD;
    accomplish before the next meeting. It also allows the team to identify any blocking issues. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_68JUYN8-Edyhmsbt0Xyl8A&quot;>[Collaboration Guidance]&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Track the status of each work item by using visual indicators of state information (for example: defined, completed,&#xD;
    accepted) in a wall or automated tool. Since iterations are typically fixed in duration, another primary way to gauge&#xD;
    progress is to continuously monitor current status and also estimate how much work remains. Plot an iteration burndown&#xD;
    chart on a daily basis in order to visualize progress on a given iteration. This chart is plotted with the total&#xD;
    estimates for all the items that are not yet started and the estimated remaining effort for any item in progress. See&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Take corrective actions to adjust the course of the iteration if the burndown chart shows that the work will not be&#xD;
    finished as planned.&#xD;

    Know about the team's problems and issues and&amp;nbsp;focus on problems that are blocking progress. A quick, daily meeting&#xD;
    is usually a good way to monitor those problems and issues. Keep&amp;nbsp;a record of issues that have to be solved within&#xD;
    the team in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    likely to take a lot of time to solve, capture it in the Work Items List so that it can be assigned to an individual.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the cause and impact of problems and exceptions as they arise. Identify possible solutions for problems that&#xD;
    have an immediate impact on the short-term goals and objectives. Identify who needs to be involved in implementing the&#xD;
    solution. Define the corrective actions and implement them.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>When a team is falling significantly behind, or critical problems occur that prevent the team from meeting the iteration&#xD;
objectives, it may be necessary to descope work to ensure that the team delivers a useful product increment by the end of&#xD;
the iteration, while maximizing stakeholder value. Work with the team and stakeholders to revise the Iteration Plan and, as&#xD;
necessary, reduce the emphasis on less critical tasks by postponing them to a subsequent iteration. In rare cases, if the&#xD;
iteration objectives still seem impossible to meet, the team might consider terminating the iteration or reformulating the&#xD;
iteration to a new objective.</sectionDescription>
