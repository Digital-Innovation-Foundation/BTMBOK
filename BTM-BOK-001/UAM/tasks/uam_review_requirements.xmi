  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to understand the context and objectives of an IT architecture project prior to reviewing the&#xD;
    architecture itself. This task ensures that all participants are up-to-speed and that they all agree on these&#xD;
    requirements. Modifications may be suggested, in which case they are documented in an &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../UAM/workproducts/uam_review_record_B5C8210C.html&quot; guid=&quot;_ON-wgPIOEdyIELoltz1wKA&quot;>Artifact: Architecture&#xD;
    Review Record&lt;/a>. These suggested changes will be reviewed along with the IT architecture in the next step, and&#xD;
    actions agreed at that stage.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This review is always done prior to the review of an IT architecture deliverable to ensure that participants in the&#xD;
    review are at the same level of understanding regarding the context and objectives.&#xD;
