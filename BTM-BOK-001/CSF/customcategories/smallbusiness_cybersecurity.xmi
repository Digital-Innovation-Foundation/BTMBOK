    ABOUT&lt;br />&#xD;
    The vast majority of smaller businesses rely on information technology to run their businesses and to store, process,&#xD;
    and transmit information. Protecting this information from unauthorized disclosure, modification, use, or deletion is&#xD;
    essential for those companies&amp;nbsp; and their customers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With limited resources and budgets, these companies need cybersecurity guidance, solutions, and training that is&#xD;
    practical, actionable, and enables them to cost-effectively address and manage their cybersecurity risks. This NIST&#xD;
    Small Business Cybersecurity Corner puts these key resources in one place.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Congress has given NIST responsibility to disseminate consistent, clear, concise, and actionable resources to small&#xD;
    businesses. All resources are free and draw from information produced by federal agencies, including NIST and several&#xD;
    primary contributors, as well non-profit organizations and several for-profit companies. These resources will be&#xD;
    updated and expanded regularly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The website does not provide operational assistance to individual companies, but it does list federal agency and some&#xD;
    non-profit contacts that can offer that assistance. Small businesses should immediately report any threats and&#xD;
    incidents to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).&lt;br />&#xD;
    Content outlined on the Small Business Cybersecurity Corner webpages contain documents and resources submitted directly&#xD;
    to us from our contributors. These resources were identified by our contributors as information they deemed most&#xD;
    relevant and timely—and were chosen based on the current needs of the small business community. Certain commercial&#xD;
    entities may be identified in this website or linked websites. Such identification is not intended to imply&#xD;
    recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are&#xD;
    necessarily the best available for the purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If your resource is publicly available on the Internet, accurate and comprehensive for a given type of cybersecurity&#xD;
    risk or risk-reducing measure, and freely available for others to use, it meets the basic criteria for potential&#xD;
    inclusion in the Small Business Cybersecurity Corner website. That includes resources from government agencies and&#xD;
    nonprofit organizations. Pay-for resources associated with non-profit entities also meet the basic criteria for&#xD;
    inclusion in the website. If your resource qualifies and you would like it considered for listing, send a description&#xD;
    of your resource to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:smallbizsecurity@nist.gov&quot;>&lt;u>&lt;font&#xD;
    color=&quot;#0066cc&quot;>smallbizsecurity@nist.gov&lt;/font>&lt;/u>&lt;/a>.&#xD;
