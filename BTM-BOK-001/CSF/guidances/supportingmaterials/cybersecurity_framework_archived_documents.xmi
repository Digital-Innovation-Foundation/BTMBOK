    The Preliminary Framework was developed by NIST using information collected through the Request for Information (RFI)&#xD;
    that was published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2013 and a series of open public workshops. The Preliminary&#xD;
    Framework was developed in response to Executive Order 13636, &quot;Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity&quot;&#xD;
    (&quot;Executive Order&quot;). Under the Executive Order, the Secretary of Commerce is tasked to direct the Director of NIST to&#xD;
    work with stakeholders to develop a framework to reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    On October 29, 2013, NIST announced a 45-day public comment period on the preliminary Framework in the Federal&#xD;
    Register. This public comment period closed on Friday, December 13, 2013 at 5:00pm EST. All comments have been posted&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Discussion Draft of the Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity is&#xD;
    now available for review. This draft is provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in&#xD;
    advance of the Fourth Cybersecurity Framework workshop on September 11-13, 2013, at the University of Texas at Dallas.&#xD;
    In addition, NIST is providing a draft Executive Overview and Illustrative Examples for review.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Participants are asked to review these discussion draft materials in advance of the workshop. The workshop is designed&#xD;
    to allow participants to offer substantive input on these versions, as well as on related topics -- including&#xD;
    implementation and governance of the Framework.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    DRAFT Outline - Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework, July 1, 2013&lt;br />&#xD;
    The purpose of this document is to define the overall Framework and provide guidance on its usage. The primary&#xD;
    audiences for the document and intended users of the Framework are critical infrastructure owners and operators and&#xD;
    their partners. However, it is expected that many organizations facing cybersecurity challenges may benefit from&#xD;
    adopting the Framework. The Framework is being designed to be relevant for organizations of nearly every size and&#xD;
    composition. It is also expected that many organizations that already are productively and successfully using&#xD;
    appropriate cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices – including those who contributed suggestions for&#xD;
    inclusion in this document – will continue to benefit by using those tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    DRAFT - Framework Core&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Framework Core offers a way to take a high-level, overarching view of an organization's management of cybersecurity&#xD;
    risk by focusing on key functions of an organization's approach to this security. These are then broken down further&#xD;
    into categories. The Framework's core structure consists of:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Five major cybersecurity functions and their categories and subcategories&lt;br />&#xD;
    Three Framework Implementation Levels associated with an organization's cybersecurity functions and how well that&#xD;
    organization implements the framework.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Preliminary Framework Compendium&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Framework's core also includes the compendium of informative references, existing standards, guidelines, and&#xD;
    practices to assist with specific implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The compendium of informative references that included standards, guidelines and best practices is provided as an&#xD;
    initial data set to map specifics to sub-categories, categories and functions. The Framework's compendium points to&#xD;
    many standards – including performance and process-based standards. These are intended to be illustrative and to assist&#xD;
    organizations in identifying and selecting standards for their own use and for use to map into the core Framework. The&#xD;
    compendium also offers practices and guidelines, including practical implementation guides.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Notice of Inquiry (NOI)&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Department of Commerce has issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) in the Federal Register to gather comments from the&#xD;
    private sector on a broad set of incentives that could help to promote the adoption of proven efforts to address&#xD;
    cybersecurity vulnerabilities.&#xD;
