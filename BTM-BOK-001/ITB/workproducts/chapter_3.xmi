    Competing in the Global Marketplace&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Why is global trade important to the United States, and how is it measured?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why do nations trade?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the barriers to international trade?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do governments and institutions foster world trade?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are international economic communities?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do companies enter the global marketplace?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What threats and opportunities exist in the global marketplace?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the advantages of multinational corporations?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the trends in the global marketplace?&lt;br />&#xD;
    This chapter examines the business world of the global marketplace. It focuses on the processes of taking a business&#xD;
    global, such as licensing agreements and franchisees; the challenges that are encountered; and the regulatory systems&#xD;
    governing the world market of the 21st century.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Today, global revolutions are under way in many areas of our lives: management, politics, communications, and&#xD;
    technology. The word global has assumed a new meaning, referring to a boundless mobility and competition in social,&#xD;
    business, and intellectual arenas. The purpose of this chapter is to explain how global trade is conducted. We also&#xD;
    discuss the barriers to international trade and the organizations that foster global trade. The chapter concludes with&#xD;
    trends in the global marketplace.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Mike Schlater Domino’s Pizza&lt;br />&#xD;
    Domino’s Pizza has more than 14,000 stores worldwide. As executive vice president of Domino’s Pizza’s international&#xD;
    division, Mike Schlater is president of Domino’s Canada with more than 440 stores. Originally from Ohio, Schlater&#xD;
    started his career with Domino's as a pizza delivery driver and worked his way up into management. Schlater saved his&#xD;
    earnings, and with some help from his brother, he was able to accept the opportunity to have the first international&#xD;
    Domino's franchise in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1983. Within weeks, Schlater’s store in Canada reached higher sales than&#xD;
    his previous store in Ohio had ever attained. However, it was not an easy start. Schlater had to identify the&#xD;
    international suppliers and get them approved to sell their products to Domino's. This shows one of the challenges that&#xD;
    organizations face when entering new global markets. To meet quality standards designed to protect a brand, companies&#xD;
    must undertake an extensive review of potential new suppliers to ensure consistent product quality. By 2007, Schlater&#xD;
    and a partner unified all of the franchises under one corporate umbrella, and Schlater is now president of Domino's of&#xD;
    Canada, Ltd., which operates more than 440 stores located in every province, as well as the Yukon and Northwest&#xD;
    Territories.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Such an impressive career path might seem like luck to some, but Schlater achieved his success due to determination and&#xD;
    attention to detail. Luck did play a role in a recent event in his live, though. Schlater manages dough in his business&#xD;
    but also came into “dough” by winning $250,000 in a lottery. Since Schlater believes in philanthropy, he donated the&#xD;
    entire amount to Cardinal Carter High School in his hometown. Over the years, Schlater has donated millions of dollars&#xD;
    to foundations and charities, such as The London Health Sciences Foundation, because he now has the ability to indulge&#xD;
    after spending decades climbing the corporate ladder at Domino’s Pizza. A father of three, he moved to Essex County&#xD;
    from Winnipeg after buying the Domino’s master franchise for Canada. He wanted to live close to the border because one&#xD;
    of his daughters was in a private school in Ohio and another was headed to university there.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The master franchisees of Domino’s Pizza’s international business are individuals or entities who, under a specific&#xD;
    licensing agreement with Domino’s, control all operations within a specific country. They operate their own stores, set&#xD;
    up a distribution infrastructure to transport materials into and throughout the country, and create subfranchisees. One&#xD;
    particular benefit of master franchisees is their local knowledge. As discussed in this chapter, a major challenge when&#xD;
    opening a business on foreign soil is negotiating the political, cultural, and economic differences of that country.&#xD;
    Master franchisees allow Domino’s, and the franchisee, to take advantage of their local expertise in dealing with&#xD;
    marketing strategies, political and regulatory issues, and the local labor market. It takes local experience to know,&#xD;
    for example, that only 30 percent of the people in Poland have phones, so carryout needs to be the focus of the&#xD;
    business; that Turkey has changed its street names three times in the past 30 years, so delivery is much more&#xD;
    challenging; or that, in Japanese, there is no word for pepperoni, the most popular topping worldwide. These are just a&#xD;
    few of the challenges that Domino’s has had to overcome on the road to becoming the worldwide leader in the pizza&#xD;
    delivery business. Under the leadership of people like Schlater, and with the help of dedicated, local master&#xD;
    franchisees, Domino’s has been able to not only compete in but to lead the global pizza delivery market.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
