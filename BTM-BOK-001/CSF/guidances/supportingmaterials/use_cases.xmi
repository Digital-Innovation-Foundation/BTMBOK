    Use cases tackle sector-specific cybersecurity challenges, which are defined by a community of sector technical&#xD;
    professionals and business leaders. Below are the sectors for which we have communities of interest and projects. If&#xD;
    you’re interested in joining one of these communities, or if you would like to engage with the center to help develop a&#xD;
    new sector, contact us today.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consumer/Retail Sector&lt;br />&#xD;
    One of the center's key priorities is to work with consumer-facing businesses to prioritize projects that will help&#xD;
    better protect corporate and customer information and assets. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, there are&#xD;
    more than 3.6 million retail establishments in the U.S., supporting more than 42 million jobs, with sales totaling&#xD;
    about $2.5 trillion in 2012. This sector forms the backbone of the U.S. economy, and with its breadth and depth,&#xD;
    improving the cybersecurity posture of these businesses will have an immense impact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Energy Sector&lt;br />&#xD;
    As part of the country's critical infrastructure, energy organizations and utilities know they must address&#xD;
    cybersecurity concerns, but many struggle with how to implement more secure technologies. The NCCoE Energy team&#xD;
    develops example solutions to help energy organizations adopt advanced security technologies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Financial Services Sector&lt;br />&#xD;
    It’s no surprise that the U.S. financial services sector is the target of cyber attacks on a daily basis. To help these&#xD;
    businesses defend against threats to their digital infrastucture and assets, the NCCoE Financial Services team works&#xD;
    with industry leaders to define projects and with technical professionals to build reference designs to address&#xD;
    important cybersecurity challenges.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Health IT Sector&lt;br />&#xD;
    Patient health information is worth more on the black market than stolen credit card information, but securing a&#xD;
    healthfcare organization requires an understanding of providers’ unique needs, such as accessibility to and usability&#xD;
    of a technology or tool. The NCCoE Health IT team tackles cybersecurity challenges with these needs in mind.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Hospitality Sector&lt;br />&#xD;
    The U.S. hospitality industry contributes nearly $600 billion to the U.S. economy and generates nearly $170 billion in&#xD;
    federal, state, and local taxes each year. Protecting this industry and its high volume of financial transactions and&#xD;
    related personally identifiable information from guest data is critical for its continued success.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Public Safety/First Responder&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NCCoE's Public Safety and First Responder (PSFR) program is working with the first responder community to implement&#xD;
    standards-based solutions to make public safety systems resilient against attack and to ensure immediate access to&#xD;
    critical assets during incident response.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Manufacturing&lt;br />&#xD;
    The manufacturing sector is quite broad, including automotive, textile, electronics, and pharmaceutical companies.&#xD;
    These organizations typically use power-driven machines or materials-handling equipment that rely on a network&#xD;
    infrastructure. As these machines become more connected via the internet, new opportunities for cyber-attacks arise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Transportation Sector&lt;br />&#xD;
    The ability to move raw materials, goods, and resources is critical to the U.S. economy, and this sector's increasing&#xD;
    digitization creates improved efficiencies, but also presents new cybersecurity risks.&#xD;
