    Understanding the Legal and Tax Environment&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this appendix, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    How does the legal system govern business transactions and settle disputes?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the required elements of a valid contract, and what are the key types of business law?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the most common taxes paid by businesses?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Understanding the Legal Environment&lt;br />&#xD;
    How does the legal system govern business transactions and settle disputes?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Our legal system affects everyone who lives and does business in the United States. The smooth functioning of society&#xD;
    depends on the law, which protects the rights of people and businesses. The purpose of law is to keep the system stable&#xD;
    while allowing orderly change. The law defines which actions are allowed or banned and regulates some practices. It&#xD;
    also helps settle disputes. The legal system both shapes and is shaped by political, economic, and social systems. As&#xD;
    Judge Learned Hand wrote in The Spirit of Liberty, “Without [the law] we cannot live; only with it can we insure the&#xD;
    future which by right is ours.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In any society, laws are the rules of conduct created and enforced by a controlling authority, usually the government.&#xD;
    They develop over time in response to the changing needs of people, property, and business. The legal system of the&#xD;
    United States is thus the result of a long and continuing process. In each generation, new social problems occur, and&#xD;
    new laws are created to solve them. For instance, in the late 1800s corporations in certain industries, such as steel&#xD;
    and oil, merged and became dominant. The Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in 1890 to control these powerful firms.&#xD;
    Eighty years later, in 1970, Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act. This law dealt with pollution&#xD;
    problems, which no one had thought about in 1890. Today new areas of law are developing to deal with the internet and&#xD;
    the recent financial scandals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Main Sources of Law&lt;br />&#xD;
    Common law is the body of unwritten law that has evolved out of judicial (court) decisions rather than being enacted by&#xD;
    legislatures. It is also called case law. It developed in England and came to America with the colonists. All states&#xD;
    except Louisiana, which follows the Napoleonic Code inherited from French settlers, follow the English system. Common&#xD;
    law is based on community customs that were recognized and enforced by the courts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Statutory law is written law enacted by legislatures at all levels, from city and state governments to the federal&#xD;
    government. Examples of statutory law are the federal and state constitutions, bills passed by Congress, and&#xD;
    ordinances, which are laws enacted by local governments. Statutory law is the chief source of new laws in the United&#xD;
    States. Among the business activities governed by statutory law are securities regulation, incorporation, sales,&#xD;
    bankruptcy, and antitrust.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Related to statutory law is administrative law, or the rules, regulations, and orders passed by boards, commissions,&#xD;
    and agencies of federal, state, and local governments. The scope and influence of administrative law have expanded as&#xD;
    the number of these government bodies has grown. Federal agencies issue more rulings and settle more disputes than all&#xD;
    the courts and legislatures combined. Some federal agencies that issue rules are the Civil Aeronautics Board, the&#xD;
    Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the National Labor&#xD;
    Relations Board.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business law is the body of law that governs commercial dealings. These laws provide a protective environment within&#xD;
    which businesses can operate. They serve as guidelines for business decisions. Every businessperson should be familiar&#xD;
    with the laws governing his or her field. Some laws, such as the Internal Revenue Code, apply to all businesses. Other&#xD;
    types of business laws may apply to a specific industry, such as Federal Communications Commission laws that regulate&#xD;
    radio and TV stations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In 1952 the United States grouped many business laws into a model that could be used by all the states. The Uniform&#xD;
    Commercial Code (UCC) sets forth the rules that apply to commercial transactions between businesses and between&#xD;
    individuals and businesses. It has been adopted by 49 states; Louisiana uses only part of it. By standardizing laws,&#xD;
    the UCC simplifies the process of doing business across state lines. It covers the sale of goods, bank deposits and&#xD;
    collections, letters of credit, documents of title, and investment securities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Court System&lt;br />&#xD;
    The United States has a highly developed court system. This branch of government, the judiciary, is responsible for&#xD;
    settling disputes by applying and interpreting points of law. Although court decisions are the basis for common law,&#xD;
    the courts also answer questions left unanswered by statutes and administrative rulings. They have the power to assure&#xD;
    that these laws do not violate the federal or state constitutions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Trial Courts&lt;br />&#xD;
    Most court cases start in the trial courts, also called courts of general jurisdiction. The main federal trial courts&#xD;
    are the U.S. district courts. There is at least one federal district court in each state. These courts hear cases&#xD;
    involving serious federal crimes, immigration, postal regulations, disputes between citizens of different states,&#xD;
    patents, copyrights, and bankruptcy. Specialized federal courts handle tax matters, international trade, and claims&#xD;
    against the United States.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Appellate Courts&lt;br />&#xD;
    The losing party in a civil (noncriminal) case and a losing defendant in a criminal case may appeal the trial court’s&#xD;
    decision to the next level in the judicial system, the appellate courts (courts of appeals). There are 12 U.S. circuit&#xD;
    courts of appeals. Cases that begin in a federal district court are appealed to the court of appeals for that district.&#xD;
    These courts may also review orders from administrative agencies. Likewise, the states have appellate courts and&#xD;
    supreme courts for cases tried in state district or superior courts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    No cases start in appellate courts. Their purpose is to review decisions of the lower courts and affirm, reverse, or&#xD;
    modify the rulings.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Supreme Court&lt;br />&#xD;
    The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court in the nation. It is the only court specifically established by the U.S.&#xD;
    Constitution. Any cases involving a state or in which an ambassador, public minister, or consul is a party are heard&#xD;
    directly by the Supreme Court. Its main function is to review decisions by the U.S. circuit courts of appeals. Parties&#xD;
    not satisfied with a decision of a state supreme court can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. But the Supreme Court&#xD;
    accepts only those cases that it believes will have the greatest effect on the country, only about 200 of the thousands&#xD;
    of appeals it gets each year.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Administrative Agencies&lt;br />&#xD;
    Administrative agencies have limited judicial powers to regulate their special areas. These agencies exist at the&#xD;
    federal, state, and local levels. For example, in 2017, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ordered satellite TV&#xD;
    provider Dish Network to pay a fine of $280 million for violating the Do Not Call Registry, a clearinghouse for&#xD;
    consumers who do not want to be contacted by telemarketers. A federal judge ruled that Dish Network was liable for more&#xD;
    than 66 million calls that violated the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Nonjudicial Methods of Settling Disputes&lt;br />&#xD;
    Settling disputes by going to court is both expensive and time-consuming. Even if the case is settled prior to the&#xD;
    actual trial, sizable legal expenses can be incurred in preparing for trial. Therefore, many companies now use private&#xD;
    arbitration and mediation firms as alternatives to litigation. Private firms offer these services, which are a high&#xD;
    growth area within the legal profession.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With arbitration, the parties agree to present their case to an impartial third party and are required to accept the&#xD;
    arbitrator’s decision. Mediation is similar, but the parties are not bound by the mediator’s decision. The mediator&#xD;
    suggests alternative solutions and helps the parties negotiate a settlement. Mediation is more flexible than&#xD;
    arbitration and allows for compromise. If the parties cannot reach a settlement, they can then go to court, an option&#xD;
    not available in most arbitration cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to saving time and money, corporations like the confidentiality of testimony and settlement terms in these&#xD;
    proceedings. Arbitration and mediation also allow businesses and medical professionals to avoid jury trials, which can&#xD;
    result in large settlements in certain types of lawsuits, such as personal injury, discrimination, medical malpractice,&#xD;
    and product liability.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Contract Law&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the required elements of a valid contract, and what are the key types of business law?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Linda Price, a 22-year-old college student, is looking at a car with a sticker price of $18,000. After some&#xD;
    negotiating, she and the salesperson agree on a price of $17,000, and the salesperson writes up a contract, which they&#xD;
    both sign. Has Linda legally bought the car for $17,000? The answer is yes, because the transaction meets all the&#xD;
    requirements for a valid contract.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A contract is an agreement that sets forth the relationship between parties regarding the performance of a specified&#xD;
    action. The contract creates a legal obligation and is enforceable in a court of law. Contracts are an important part&#xD;
    of business law. Contract law is also incorporated into other fields of business law, such as property and agency law.&#xD;
    Some of the business transactions that involve contracts are buying materials and property, selling goods, leasing&#xD;
    equipment, and hiring consultants.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A contract can be an express contract, which specifies the terms of the agreement in either written or spoken words, or&#xD;
    an implied contract, which depends on the acts and conduct of the parties to show agreement. An example of an express&#xD;
    contract is the written sales contract for Linda Price’s new car. An implied contract exists when you order and receive&#xD;
    a sandwich at Jason’s Grill. You and the restaurant have an implied contract that you will pay the price shown on the&#xD;
    restaurant’s menu in exchange for an edible sandwich.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Contract Requirements&lt;br />&#xD;
    Businesses deal with contracts all the time, so it’s important to know the requirements of a valid contract. For a&#xD;
    contract to be legally enforceable, all of the following elements must be present:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mutual assent. Voluntary agreement by both parties to the terms of the contract. Each party to the contract must have&#xD;
    entered into it freely, without duress. Using physical or economic harm to force the signing of the&#xD;
    contract—threatening injury or refusing to place another large order, for instance—invalidates a contract. Likewise,&#xD;
    fraud—misrepresenting the facts of a transaction—makes a contract unenforceable. Telling a prospective used-car buyer&#xD;
    that the brakes are new when in fact they have not been replaced makes the contract of sale invalid.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Capacity. Legal ability of a party to enter into contracts. Under the law, minors (those under 18), mental&#xD;
    incompetents, drug and alcohol addicts, and convicts cannot enter into contracts.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Consideration. Exchange of some legal value or benefit between the parties. Consideration can be in the form of money,&#xD;
    goods, or a legal right given up. Suppose that an electronics manufacturer agrees to rent an industrial building for a&#xD;
    year at a monthly rent of $1,500. Its consideration is the rent payment of $1,500, and the building owner’s&#xD;
    consideration is permission to occupy the space. But if you offer to type a term paper for a friend for free and your&#xD;
    offer is accepted, there is no contract. Your friend has not given up anything, so you are not legally bound to honor&#xD;
    the deal.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Legal purpose. Absence of illegality. The purpose of the contract must be legal for it to be valid. A contract cannot&#xD;
    require performance of an illegal act. A contract to smuggle drugs into a state for a specified amount of money would&#xD;
    not be legally enforceable.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Legal form. Oral or written form, as required. Many contracts can be oral. For instance, an oral contract exists when&#xD;
    Bridge Corp. orders office supplies by phone from Ace Stationery Store and Ace delivers the requested goods. Written&#xD;
    contracts include leases, sales contracts, and property deeds. Some types of contracts must be in writing to be legally&#xD;
    binding. In most states, written contracts are required for the sale of goods costing more than $500, for the sale of&#xD;
    land, for contract performance that cannot be carried out within a year, and for guarantees to pay the debts of someone&#xD;
    else.&lt;br />&#xD;
    As you can see, Linda Price’s car purchase meets all the requirements for a valid contract. Both parties have freely&#xD;
    agreed to the terms of the contract. Linda is not a minor and presumably does not fit any of the other categories of&#xD;
    incapacity. Both parties are giving consideration, Linda by paying the money and the salesperson by turning over the&#xD;
    car to her. The purchase of the car is a legal activity. And the written contract is the correct form because the cost&#xD;
    of the car is over $500.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Breach of Contract&lt;br />&#xD;
    A breach of contract occurs when one party to a contract fails (without legal excuse) to fulfill the terms of the&#xD;
    agreement. The other party then has the right to seek a remedy in the courts. There are three legal remedies for breach&#xD;
    of contract:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Payment of damages. Money awarded to the party who was harmed by the breach of contract, to cover losses incurred&#xD;
    because the contract wasn’t fulfilled. Suppose that Ajax Roofing contracts with Fred Wellman to fix the large hole in&#xD;
    the roof of his factory within three days. But the roofing crew doesn’t show up as promised. When a thunderstorm four&#xD;
    days later causes $45,000 in damage to Wellman’s machinery, Wellman can sue for damages to cover the costs of the water&#xD;
    damage because Ajax breached the contract.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Specific performance of the contract. A court order requiring the breaching party to perform the duties under the terms&#xD;
    of the contract. Specific performance is the most common method of settling a breach of contract. Wellman might ask the&#xD;
    court to direct Ajax to fix the roof at the price and conditions in the contract.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Restitution. Canceling the contract and returning to the situation that existed before the contract. If one party fails&#xD;
    to perform under the contract, neither party has any further obligation to the other. Because Ajax failed to fix&#xD;
    Wellman’s roof under the terms of the contract, Wellman does not owe Ajax any money. Ajax must return the 50 percent&#xD;
    deposit it received when Wellman signed the contract.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Warranties&lt;br />&#xD;
    Express warranties are specific statements of fact or promises about a product by the seller. This form of warranty is&#xD;
    considered part of the sales transaction that influences the buyer. Express warranties appear in the form of statements&#xD;
    that can be interpreted as fact. The statement “This machine will process 1,000 gallons of paint per hour” is an&#xD;
    express warranty, as is the printed warranty that comes with a computer or a telephone answering machine.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Implied warranties are neither written nor oral. These guarantees are imposed on sales transactions by statute or court&#xD;
    decision. They promise that the product will perform up to expected standards. For instance, a man bought a used car&#xD;
    from a dealer, and the next day the transmission fell out as he was driving on the highway. The dealer fixed the car,&#xD;
    but a week later the brakes failed. The man sued the car dealer. The court ruled in favor of the car owner because any&#xD;
    car without a working transmission or brakes is not fit for the ordinary purpose of driving. Similarly, if a customer&#xD;
    asks to buy a copier to handle 5,000 copies per month, she relies on the salesperson to sell her a copier that meets&#xD;
    those needs. The salesperson implicitly warrants that the copier purchased is appropriate for that volume.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks&lt;br />&#xD;
    The U.S. Constitution protects authors, inventors, and creators of other intellectual property by giving them the&#xD;
    rights to their creative works. Patents, copyrights, and registration of trademarks and servicemarks are legal&#xD;
    protection for key business assets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A patent gives an inventor the exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell an invention for 20 years. The U.S. Patent&#xD;
    Office, a government agency, grants patents for ideas that meet its requirements of being new, unique, and useful. The&#xD;
    physical process, machine, or formula is what is patented. Patent rights—pharmaceutical companies’ rights to produce&#xD;
    drugs they discover, for example—are considered intangible personal property.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The government also grants copyrights. A copyright is an exclusive right, shown by the symbol &amp;copy;, given to a writer,&#xD;
    artist, composer, or playwright to use, produce, and sell her or his creation. Works protected by copyright include&#xD;
    printed materials (books, magazine articles, lectures), works of art, photographs, and movies. Under current copyright&#xD;
    law, the copyright is issued for the life of the creator plus 70 years after the creator’s death. Patents and&#xD;
    copyrights, which are considered intellectual property, are the subject of many lawsuits today.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A trademark is a design, name, or other distinctive mark that a manufacturer uses to identify its goods in the&#xD;
    marketplace. Apple’s “bitten apple” logo (symbol) is an example of a trademark. A servicemark is a symbol, name, or&#xD;
    design that identifies a service rather than a tangible object. The Travelers Insurance umbrella logo is an example of&#xD;
    a servicemark.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most companies identify their trademark with the &amp;reg; symbol in company ads. This symbol shows that the trademark is&#xD;
    registered with the Register of Copyrights, Copyright Office, Library of Congress. The trademark is followed by a&#xD;
    generic description: Fritos corn chips, Xerox copiers, Scotch brand tape, Kleenex tissues.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Trademarks are valuable because they create uniqueness in the minds of customers. At the same time, companies don’t&#xD;
    want a trademark to become so well known that it is used to describe all similar types of products. For instance, Coke&#xD;
    is often used to refer to any cola soft drink, not just those produced by The Coca-Cola Company. Companies spend&#xD;
    millions of dollars each year to keep their trademarks from becoming generic words, terms used to identify a product&#xD;
    class rather than the specific product. The Coca-Cola Company employs many investigators and files many lawsuits each&#xD;
    year to prevent its trademarks from becoming generic words.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once a trademark becomes generic (which a court decides), it is public property and can be used by any person or&#xD;
    company. Names that were once trademarked but are now generic include aspirin, thermos, linoleum, and toll house&#xD;
    cookies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tort Law&lt;br />&#xD;
    A tort is a civil, or private, act that harms other people or their property. The harm may involve physical injury,&#xD;
    emotional distress, invasion of privacy, or defamation (injuring a person’s character by publication of false&#xD;
    statements). The injured party may sue the wrongdoer to recover damages for the harm or loss. A tort is not the result&#xD;
    of a breach of contract, which would be settled under contract law. Torts are part of common law. Examples of tort&#xD;
    cases are medical malpractice, slander (an untrue oral statement that damages a person’s reputation), libel (an untrue&#xD;
    written statement that damages a person’s reputation), product liability (discussed in the next section), and fraud.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A tort is generally not a crime, although some acts can be both torts and crimes. (Assault and battery, for instance,&#xD;
    is a criminal act that would be prosecuted by the state and also a tort because of the injury to the person.) Torts are&#xD;
    private wrongs and are settled in civil courts. Crimes are violations of public law punishable by the state or county&#xD;
    in the criminal courts. The purpose of criminal law is to punish the person who committed the crime. The purpose of&#xD;
    tort law is to provide remedies to the injured party.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For a tort to exist and damages to be recovered, the harm must be done through either negligence or deliberate intent.&#xD;
    Negligence occurs when reasonable care is not taken for the safety of others. For instance, a woman attending a New&#xD;
    York Mets baseball game was struck on the head by a foul ball that came through a hole in the screen behind home plate.&#xD;
    The court ruled that a sports team charging admission has an obligation to provide structures free from defects and&#xD;
    seating that protects spectators from danger. The Mets were found negligent. Negligence does not apply when an injury&#xD;
    is caused by an unavoidable accident, an event that was not intended and could not have been prevented even if the&#xD;
    person used reasonable care. This area of tort law is quite controversial, because the definition of negligence leaves&#xD;
    much room for interpretation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product-Liability Law&lt;br />&#xD;
    Product liability refers to manufacturers’ and sellers’ responsibility for defects in the products they make and sell.&#xD;
    It has become a specialized area of law combining aspects of contracts, warranties, torts, and statutory law (at both&#xD;
    the state and federal levels). A product-liability suit may be based on negligence or strict liability (both of which&#xD;
    are torts) or misrepresentation or breach of warranty (part of contract law).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An important concept in product-liability law is strict liability. A manufacturer or seller is liable for any personal&#xD;
    injury or property damage caused by defective products or packaging—even if all possible care was used to prevent such&#xD;
    defects. The definition of defective is quite broad. It includes manufacturing and design defects and inadequate&#xD;
    instructions on product use or warnings of danger.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product-liability suits are very costly. More than 100,000 product-liability suits were filed against hundreds of&#xD;
    companies that made or used asbestos, a substance that causes lung disease and cancer but was once used widely in&#xD;
    insulation, brake linings, textiles, and other products. Scores of companies were forced into bankruptcy as a result of&#xD;
    asbestos-related lawsuits, and the total cost of asbestos cases to defendants and their insurers exceeds $70 billion&#xD;
    (most of which was paid not to the victims but to lawyers and experts).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Bankruptcy Law&lt;br />&#xD;
    Congress has given financially distressed firms and individuals a way to make a fresh start. Bankruptcy is the legal&#xD;
    procedure by which individuals or businesses that cannot meet their financial obligations are relieved of their debts.&#xD;
    A bankruptcy court distributes any assets to the creditors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Bankruptcy can be either voluntary or involuntary. In a voluntary bankruptcy, the debtor files a petition with the&#xD;
    court, stating that debts exceed assets and asking the court to declare the debtor bankrupt. In an involuntary&#xD;
    bankruptcy, the creditors file the bankruptcy petition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, amended in 1984 and 1986, provides for the resolution of bankruptcy cases. Under&#xD;
    this act, two types of bankruptcy proceedings are available to businesses: Chapter 7 (liquidation) and Chapter 11&#xD;
    (reorganization). Most bankruptcies, an estimated 70 percent, use Chapter 7. After the sale of any assets, the cash&#xD;
    proceeds are given first to secured creditors and then to unsecured creditors. A firm that opts to reorganize under&#xD;
    Chapter 11 works with its creditors to develop a plan for paying part of its debts and writing off the rest.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act went into effect October 17, 2005. Under this law,&#xD;
    Americans with heavy debt will find it difficult to avoid meeting their financial obligations. Many debtors will have&#xD;
    to work out repayment plans instead of having their obligations erased in bankruptcy court.2&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The law requires people with incomes above a certain level to pay some or all of their credit-card charges, medical&#xD;
    bills, and other obligations under a court-ordered bankruptcy plan. Supporters of the 2005 law argue that bankruptcy&#xD;
    frequently is the last refuge of gamblers, impulsive shoppers, the divorced or separated, and fathers avoiding child&#xD;
    support. Now there is an objective, needs-based bankruptcy test to determine whether filers should be allowed to cancel&#xD;
    their debts or be required to enter a repayment plan. Generally, people with incomes above the state median income&#xD;
    would be required to use a plan to repay their debts. People with special circumstances, such as serious medical&#xD;
    conditions, would be allowed to cancel debts despite this income level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also, companies will need a lot more cash to enter into a bankruptcy than in the past. Before the 2005 law, utilities&#xD;
    could not discontinue service as a result of a bankruptcy filing. But under the new act, the filing company must post a&#xD;
    cash deposit or equivalent in order to continue their service. Sellers also have priority over other claims with regard&#xD;
    to merchandise distributed to the debtor within 20 days prior to the bankruptcy filing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The act limits the debtor’s exclusivity period, which was a real boon of filing for bankruptcy. Past law allowed for&#xD;
    indefinite extensions, which served to drag out the time before bondholders and other creditors get any money. But now&#xD;
    that period is capped at 18 months, with no room for extension. For large corporations with complicated bankruptcies,&#xD;
    such a quick turnaround may not be possible, and if a plan is not filed at the end of 18 months, the company must put&#xD;
    itself at the mercy of creditors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Laws to Promote Fair Competition&lt;br />&#xD;
    Many measures have been taken to try to keep the marketplace free from influences that would restrict competition.&#xD;
    These efforts include antitrust regulation, laws that prevent companies from entering into agreements to control trade&#xD;
    through a monopoly. The first act regulating competition was the Sherman Antitrust Act, passed in 1890 to prevent large&#xD;
    companies from dominating an industry and making it hard for smaller firms to compete. This broad act banned monopolies&#xD;
    and contracts, mergers, or conspiracies in restraint of trade. In 1914 the Clayton Act added to the more general&#xD;
    provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act. It outlawed the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Price discrimination. Offering a customer discounts that are not offered to all other purchasers buying on similar&#xD;
    terms&lt;br />&#xD;
    Exclusive dealing. Refusing to let the buyer purchase a competitor’s products for resale&lt;br />&#xD;
    Tying contracts. Requiring buyers to purchase merchandise they may not want in order to get the products they do&#xD;
    want&lt;br />&#xD;
    Purchase of stock in competing corporations so as to lessen competition. Buying competitors’ stock in such quantity&#xD;
    that competition is reduced&lt;br />&#xD;
    The 1950 Celler-Kefauver Act amended the Clayton Act. It bans the purchase of one firm by another if the resulting&#xD;
    merger decreases competition within the industry. As a result, all corporate acquisitions are subject to regulatory&#xD;
    approval before they can be finalized. Most antitrust actions are taken by the U.S. Department of Justice, based on&#xD;
    federal law. Violations of the antitrust acts are punishable by fines, imprisonment, or civil damage payments that can&#xD;
    be as high as three times the actual damage amount. These outcomes give defendants an incentive to resolve cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Federal Trade Commission Act, also passed in 1914, bans unfair trade practices. This act created the Federal Trade&#xD;
    Commission (FTC), an independent five-member board with the power to define and monitor unfair trade practices, such as&#xD;
    those prohibited by the Sherman and Clayton Acts. The FTC investigates complaints and can issue rulings called&#xD;
    cease-and-desist orders to force companies to stop unfair business practices. Its powers have grown over the years.&#xD;
    Today the FTC is one of the most important agencies regulating the competitive practices of business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Regulation of Advertising and Pricing&lt;br />&#xD;
    A number of federal laws directly affect the promotion and pricing of products. The Wheeler-Lea Act of 1938 amended the&#xD;
    Federal Trade Commission Act and gave the FTC authority to regulate advertising. The FTC monitors companies’&#xD;
    advertisements for false or misleading claims.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The most important law in the area of pricing is the Robinson-Patman Act, a federal law passed in 1936 that tightened&#xD;
    the Clayton Act’s prohibitions against price discrimination. An exception is made for circumstances like discounts for&#xD;
    quantity purchases, as long as the discounts do not lessen competition. But a manufacturer cannot sell at a lower price&#xD;
    to one company just because that company buys all its merchandise from the manufacturer. Also, if one firm is offered&#xD;
    quantity discounts, all firms buying that quantity of goods must get the discounts. The FTC and the antitrust division&#xD;
    of the Justice Department monitor pricing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consumer Protection Laws&lt;br />&#xD;
    Consumerism reflects the struggle for power between buyers and sellers. Specifically, it is a social movement seeking&#xD;
    to increase the rights and powers of buyers vis-à-vis sellers. Sellers’ rights and powers include the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To introduce into the marketplace any product, in any size and style, that is not hazardous to personal health or&#xD;
    safety, or if it is hazardous, to introduce it with the proper warnings and controls&lt;br />&#xD;
    To price the product at any level they wish, provided they do not discriminate among similar classes of buyers&lt;br />&#xD;
    To spend any amount of money they wish to promote the product, so long as the promotion does not constitute unfair&#xD;
    competition&lt;br />&#xD;
    To formulate any message they wish about the product, provided that it is not misleading or dishonest in content or&#xD;
    execution&lt;br />&#xD;
    To introduce any buying incentives they wish&lt;br />&#xD;
    Meanwhile, buyers have the following rights and powers:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To refuse to buy any product that is offered to them&lt;br />&#xD;
    To expect products to be safe&lt;br />&#xD;
    To expect a product to be essentially as the seller represents it&lt;br />&#xD;
    To receive adequate information about the product&lt;br />&#xD;
    Many laws have been passed to protect consumer rights. Table A2 lists the major consumer protection laws.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Deregulation of Industries&lt;br />&#xD;
    During the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. government actively promoted deregulation, the removal of rules and regulations&#xD;
    governing business competition. Deregulation drastically changed some once-regulated industries (especially the&#xD;
    transportation, telecommunications, and financial services industries) and created many new competitors. The result has&#xD;
    been entries into and exits from some industries. One of the latest industries to deregulate is the electric power&#xD;
    industry. With almost 200 investor-owned electric utilities, it is the largest industry to be deregulated so far.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consumers typically benefit from deregulation. Increased competition often means lower prices. Businesses also benefit&#xD;
    because they have more freedom to operate and can avoid the costs associated with government regulations. But more&#xD;
    competition can also make it hard for small or weak firms to survive.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Regulation of the Internet&lt;br />&#xD;
    Use of the internet has exploded over the past decade. Recent estimates suggest that more than half of the world’s&#xD;
    population use the web to purchase goods and services, book travel plans, conduct banking and pay bills, stream&#xD;
    original content, read the latest news and sports information, look up facts and figures, and keep up with friends,&#xD;
    family, and business associates via Skype, FaceTime, Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms.3&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Internet access and regulation continue to be a concern for many interest groups, including privacy advocates, internet&#xD;
    providers, private citizens, technology companies, and the government, to name a few. In 2017, President Trump signed&#xD;
    legislation overturning the internet privacy protections originally put in place by the Obama administration. Under the&#xD;
    new legislation, internet providers will now be able to collect, store, share, and sell certain types of customer&#xD;
    information without their consent. Under previous legislation, sharing this type of data would have required consumers’&#xD;
    permission. With this new law, companies such as Verizon and Comcast will be able to mine user data and use that&#xD;
    information to compete in the $83 billion digital advertising market with companies such as Google and Facebook.4 The&#xD;
    internet environment is extremely dynamic, so consumers and other interest groups should monitor how regulations and&#xD;
    other policies will continue to change the ground rules for internet use.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Understanding the Tax Environment of Business&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the most common taxes paid by businesses?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Taxes are sometimes seen as the price we pay to live in this country. Taxes are assessed by all levels of government on&#xD;
    both business and individuals, and they are used to pay for the services provided by government. The federal government&#xD;
    is the largest collector of taxes, accounting for 52 percent of all tax dollars. States are next, followed closely by&#xD;
    local government taxes. The average American family pays about 37 percent of its income for taxes, 28 percent to the&#xD;
    federal government and 9 percent to state and local governments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Income Taxes&lt;br />&#xD;
    Income taxes are based on the income received by businesses and individuals. The income taxes paid to the federal&#xD;
    government are set by Congress, regulated by the Internal Revenue Code, and collected by the Internal Revenue Service.&#xD;
    These taxes are progressive, meaning that rates increase as income increases. Most of the states and some large cities&#xD;
    also collect income taxes from individuals and businesses. The state and local governments establish their own rules&#xD;
    and tax rates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Other Types of Taxes&lt;br />&#xD;
    Besides income taxes, individuals and businesses pay a number of other taxes. The four main types are property taxes,&#xD;
    payroll taxes, sales taxes, and excise taxes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Property taxes are assessed on real and personal property, based on the assessed value of the property. They raise&#xD;
    quite a bit of revenue for state and local governments. Most states tax land and buildings. Property taxes may be based&#xD;
    on fair market value (what a buyer would pay), a percentage of fair market value, or replacement value (what it would&#xD;
    cost today to rebuild or buy something like the original). The value on which the taxes are based is the assessed&#xD;
    value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any business that has employees and meets a payroll must pay payroll taxes, the employer’s share of Social Security&#xD;
    taxes and federal and state unemployment taxes. These taxes must be paid on wages, salaries, and commissions. State&#xD;
    unemployment taxes are based on the number of employees in a firm who have become eligible for unemployment benefits. A&#xD;
    firm that has never had an employee become eligible for unemployment will pay a low rate of state unemployment taxes.&#xD;
    The firm’s experience with employment benefits does not affect federal unemployment tax rates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sales taxes are levied on goods when they are sold and are a percentage of the sales price. These taxes are imposed by&#xD;
    states, counties, and cities. They vary in amount and in what is considered taxable. Some states have no sales tax.&#xD;
    Others tax some categories (such as appliances) but not others (such as clothes). Still others tax all retail products&#xD;
    except food, magazines, and prescription drugs. Sales taxes increase the cost of goods to the consumer. Businesses bear&#xD;
    the burden of collecting sales taxes and sending them to the government.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Excise taxes are placed on specific items, such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, airline tickets, cars,&#xD;
    and guns. They can be assessed by federal, state, and local governments. In many cases, these taxes help pay for&#xD;
    services related to the item taxed. For instance, gasoline excise taxes are often used to build and repair highways.&#xD;
    Other excise taxes—such as those on alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and guns—are used to control practices that may&#xD;
    cause harm.&#xD;
