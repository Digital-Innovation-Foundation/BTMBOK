    The checklist below is provided to help in determining if the IT architecture artifacts review is&amp;nbsp;comprehensive.&#xD;
    The architectural review&amp;nbsp;provides an opportunity for all aspects of the artifacts and IT architecture to be&#xD;
    agreed, for other opinions to be heard and a consensus reached. Actions are also agreed to ensure that issues are&#xD;
    resolved and updated made as decided during the review.&#xD;

    The models should&amp;nbsp;have a similar&amp;nbsp;level of complexity and&amp;nbsp;a consistent level of abstraction (but perhaps&#xD;
    tempered by the objectives of the IT Architecture). This is a relative evaluation, therefore as always when creating an&#xD;
    architecture the level of complexity and detail required is always a judgment call. The level required should be driven&#xD;
    by the intended use for the IT architecture. The level of abstraction for a give level of detail must however be&#xD;
    consistent.&amp;nbsp;Issues are flagged and actions defined to correct them.&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_UBRtEEsREeOMAZ8QX11Frg" name="Components in the models are highly cohesive " guid="_UBRtEEsREeOMAZ8QX11Frg">
    <sectionDescription>One of the main objectives in doing IT architecture is to define the overall structure of the &quot;system&quot;. The components that&#xD;
define this structure must be cohesive, which is enabled by having clear&amp;nbsp;separations of concerns in the model&#xD;
and&amp;nbsp;in having clear relationships between components.&amp;nbsp; Issues are flagged and actions defined to correct them.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_nCVGsEsSEeOMAZ8QX11Frg" name="The proposed solution can be easily understood" guid="_nCVGsEsSEeOMAZ8QX11Frg">
    <sectionDescription>Clear understanding of the IT architecture is greatly facilitated through the use of standard domain 'language' in the&#xD;
models (which may need to be clarified in order to be more precise). Visual models are also an aid to understanding.&#xD;
Complexity (in models and descriptions) can be reduced through the layering of the models (i.e. encapsulation to hide&#xD;
detail). This peer review (and other reviews) also facilitate and aid in documenting architectures in a manner and language&#xD;
understandable by all, and consistent across the enterprise. Issues are flagged and actions defined to correct them.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Stakeholders should all share the same viewâ€”this is where getting consensus on the language and other aspects is very&#xD;
important. This IT architecture review is where to get feedback and to develop a solid consensus and understanding.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Presenting a consistent set of views and structures aids in understanding, eases maintenance of the models, and generally&#xD;
speeds up the process. These modeling guidelines and standards are either from UAM or defined&amp;nbsp; and used within the&#xD;
enterprise.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Given the objectives of the IT architecture, the models developed should be only as complex as needed. Overly complex model&#xD;
will not add value, will be more difficult to maintain and take longer to develop.</sectionDescription>

        Layer boundaries are respected within the architecture;&#xD;

    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        Layers are used to encapsulate conceptual boundaries between different kinds of services and provide useful&#xD;
        abstractions which makes the design easier to understand.&#xD;
