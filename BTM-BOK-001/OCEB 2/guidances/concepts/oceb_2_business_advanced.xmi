    With this level of knowledge and expertise, and a corresponding amount of industry experience, a BPM Practitioner&#xD;
    holding the OCEB Business Advanced Level Certification could be qualified to lead a major BPM project implementation&#xD;
    from the business community perspective, or to advise senior management on the application and optimization of business&#xD;
    processes to achieve strategic goals. He or she could be able to provide both visionary and practical guidance for&#xD;
    large-scale enterprise-wide BPM deployments with highly complex interdependent processes, or establish and manage a BPM&#xD;
    Center of Excellence (CoE), or design and provide in-depth business-oriented training and quality assurance for BPM&#xD;
    technologies. This examination, with little BPMN content, is not being modified in the transition to OCEB 2.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The OCEB 2 Business Advanced Certification requires OCEB 2 Business Intermediate Certification as prerequisite. The&#xD;
    OCEB 2 Business Advanced Certification expires five years from the date the Business Advanced exam is passed.&#xD;
