    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Technical entities represent &quot;things&quot; consumed or produced by (technical) activities.&amp;nbsp;It represents something of&#xD;
    value to the enterprise, therefore&amp;nbsp;the business entity object is likely persistent. They are also a representation&#xD;
    of&amp;nbsp;real-world objects within enterprise systems and processes, &lt;em>customer&lt;/em> for example, and as such they&#xD;
    will have relationships with many other entities within the enterprise. The attributes of the entities reflect their&#xD;
    purpose and usage, but should not have attributes that define how and by whom it should be used. These are business&#xD;
    rules, defined external to entities and workflow and are separate objects themselves.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the technical level,&amp;nbsp;implementation decisions are made, such as&amp;nbsp;Oracle vs. Sybase,&amp;nbsp;along&#xD;
    with&amp;nbsp;the specifics of &lt;em>tables&lt;/em> and &lt;em>primary keys&lt;/em> and other such details. Again, the level of detail&#xD;
    specified depends upon the scope, context and objectives of the IT architecture effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This technical level involves the transformation of the logical data model into detailed and perhaps optimized physical&#xD;
    database table designs, or other physical representations. The physical design of a database involves deep use of&#xD;
    particular database management technology. For example, a table/column design could be implemented on a collection of&#xD;
    computers, located in different parts of the world. That is the domain of the physical implementation project(s)â€”the&#xD;
    technology model in the IT architecture context will likely not specify the solution to that level of detail..&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Difference&amp;nbsp;Between Logical &amp;amp; Physical Data Model&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    People often get confused with the fact that logical and physical data model is very different in their objective, goal&#xD;
    and content. Following are some key differences.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;table title=&quot;Logical vs. Physical Models&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot; summary=&quot;Logical vs. Physical&quot;&#xD;

            &lt;th>&#xD;
                Physical Data Model&#xD;
            &lt;/th>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Includes entities, attributes and relationships&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Includes tables, columns, keys, data types, validation rules, database triggers, stored procedures,&#xD;
                domains, and access constraints&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Uses business names for attributes&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Uses abbreviated column names limited by the database management system (DBMS)&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Is independent of technology (platform, DBMS)&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Includes primary keys and indices for fast data access.&#xD;

            &lt;td>&#xD;

            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                May be de-normalized to meet performance requirements&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;

            &lt;/td>&#xD;

            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
&lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Attributes&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An &lt;b>attribute&lt;/b> of a class represents a piece of information about an object of that class that is kept with the&#xD;
    object. An attribute has an attribute type. Each attribute and attribute type, respectively, has a name.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An object normally holds different pieces of information that describe some of its characteristics. Such pieces of&#xD;
    information can either be described implicitly in the textual description of the object's class or modeled explicitly&#xD;
    as an attribute of the class.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An attribute is of a certain type. An attribute has a name, preferably a noun that describes the attribute's role in&#xD;
    relation to the class. An attribute type can be more or less primitive, for example a simple number or string.&#xD;
    Different classes can have attributes with identical structures. Those attributes should share a description; that is,&#xD;
    they should share an attribute type.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Attributes vs. Entities&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A key consideration in modeling the entities is always the question: entity or attribute? In other words, is the&#xD;
    &quot;thing&quot; in question important and involved enough to be modeled as an entity, or should it simply be an attribute of&#xD;
    another entity? As always when doing architectures the short answer is &quot;it depends&quot;. It depends, in this case, upon how&#xD;
    the &quot;thing&quot; is used within the enterprise. Is it simply a bit of information or are there other attributes about the&#xD;
    thing that need to be understood and used?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the phenomenon you wish to model is not used by any other class, you can model it as an attribute of an entity&#xD;
    class, or even as a relationship between entity classes. On the other hand, if the phenomenon is used by any other&#xD;
    class in the design model, or if there are attributes about the phenomenon required, then you must model it as a class.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Characteristics of Good Business Entities&quot; name=&quot;Characteristics of Good Business Entities&quot;>Characteristics of a&#xD;
    Good Technical Entity&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Its name and description are clear and understandable.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Entity relationships do not depend on each other.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each relationship is used in the workflow of at least one activity.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All &quot;things&quot; in the business, such as products, documents, contracts, and so on, are modeled as entities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It participates in at least one &lt;em>activity&lt;/em>.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Business Events&quot; name=&quot;Business Events&quot;>System Events&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Events can be used to notify interested parties (including other entities or activities) of a change in state of the&#xD;
    entity. The creation and destruction of an entity may be significant. If you have defined a state machine for an&#xD;
    entity, examine the defined states. Each transition is a potential (business) event. Also inspect the attributes and&#xD;
    operations of the entity. Significant operations that are used infrequently may have an event associated with them.&#xD;
    Changes to important attributes may trigger an event. Process patterns and entity patterns may also provide insight&#xD;
    into useful events. For example, if a business entity must be approved before being used further, a&#xD;
    &lt;i>&amp;lt;something&amp;gt; Approved&lt;/i> business event may be useful to notify other parties. For more information on finding&#xD;
    events, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_business_event_82E69349.html&quot;&#xD;
