A project portfolio is a collection of projects, programmes and other activities, which are grouped together to allow
better control over their financial and other resources and to facilitate their effective management in terms of meeting
strategic objectives. The projects or programmes in a portfolio are not necessarily inter-dependent on inter-related. From
a strategic point of view, portfolios are higher-level components than programmes and projects. It is at the portfolio
level that investment decisions are made, resources allocated, and priorities identified. &lt;a
