    &lt;strong>What is design?&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Design involves finding solutions that fit the user, task, and context of use. Properly designed objects -- including&#xD;
    software, tools, and web sites -- fit their context so well that they are easy to use and beneficial to the user.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Design is:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>A discipline&lt;/strong> that explores the dialogue between products, people, and contexts.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>A process&lt;/strong> that defines a solution to help people achieve their goals.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>An artifact&lt;/strong> produced as the result of solution definition.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Design as a Discipline&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Design is a discipline with a long history and many branches or areas of specialty. The usability profession is&#xD;
    primarily concerned with Interaction Design (IxD), a newer branch of design dedicated to defining the behavior of&#xD;
    digital products and systems. More traditional branches of design include Industrial Design (ID), which focuses on&#xD;
    optimizing the function, value and appearance of physical objects, and Graphic Design (GD), which has strong roots in&#xD;
    graphic arts and print media, and focuses on bringing together the meaning and appearance of a product. All branches of&#xD;
    design involve innovating a new &quot;form&quot; or object that fits well into the context in which it will be used (Alexander,&#xD;
    1970).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Design as a Process&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    There are established processes for interaction design in the context of a User-Centered Design (UCD) methodology.&#xD;
    Designers must balance a variety of considerations, including the needs and goals of the users, the constraints imposed&#xD;
    by the context of use, and the challenges that arise naturally from the interaction between humans and machines; to&#xD;
    come up with solutions. Commonly used design methods include paper prototyping and cognitive walkthroughs. The design&#xD;
    process is &quot;iterative&quot; meaning that proposed solutions are refined through repeated cycles of prototype evaluation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Design can occur on several different levels, which build on one another (Garrett, 2002). At a minimum, we can&#xD;
    distinguish:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;strong>Conceptual design&lt;/strong> is a basic foundation that defines the structure of the solution, including&#xD;
            the functional elements of the product, their relationships and the system behavior. Conceptual design is the&#xD;
            vital stage of the product creation that defines the success or failure of the product usability.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;strong>Physical design&lt;/strong> is a more refined level that defines the aesthetics of the solution. This&#xD;
            includes, for example language (and, to some extent, content) and branding. In contrast with conceptual design,&#xD;
            physical design defines the success or failure of the product appeal.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Design as an Artifact&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The design process results in producing design artifacts that feed the consequent stages of product development. Design&#xD;
    artifacts include various system models, design specifications, style guides, and prototypes, including low-fidelity&#xD;
    prototypes, such as sketches and wireframes, and high-fidelity prototypes, such as mockups and system demos.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Achieving Usability Through Interaction Design&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Good, usable products never happen by chance. Rather, they are achieved through design that is based on an&#xD;
    understanding of the natural physical, psychological, and emotional characteristics of human beings, their tasks and&#xD;
    work environment; the constraints of the technology; and creating an interactive experience that best &quot;fits&quot; the&#xD;
    context and enables the human users to be successful.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Well designed products are easier to use (and/or learn to use) and are more beneficial to the user than poorly designed&#xD;
    ones. Good design can increase productivity, satisfaction, and user acceptance. Good design can also focus limited&#xD;
    resources towards building products which satisfy the goals of the user and away from products and features which do&#xD;
    not (Cooper, 1999). Finally, design can impact commercial success: a usable design can be a decisive factor in a&#xD;
    competitive marketplace.&#xD;
