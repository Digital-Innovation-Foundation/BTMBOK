    This process delivers the combined tasks, techniques, and guidance from the Unified Architecture Method (UAM), but&#xD;
    integrated with and augmented through reference to other supporting material. The delivery process is intended to focus&#xD;
    the reader only on those aspects core to&amp;nbsp;UAM architecture definition, and while there may be additional useful&#xD;
    techniques referred to within the methodology, the delivery process brings to the fore the necessary critical elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The phases described in this delivery process are intended to be iterative in themselves as well as an assumption that&#xD;
    multiple instances of these processes may be underway with the enterprise. For example, given a complete set of&#xD;
    artifacts from the Business&amp;nbsp;Perspective phase, multiple&amp;nbsp;Logical Perspective&amp;nbsp;phases may be executed to&#xD;
    divide up the architecture effort, likely along business lines, business&amp;nbsp;domains, or projects.&amp;nbsp;Each IT&#xD;
    architecture project will be responsible for progressing a subset of the EA level architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>IT architecture is mandatory in any organization with more than about 100 employees, or even less. System&#xD;
and&amp;nbsp;processes and people are all interconnected, through networks and other ways, in order to support the goals of the&#xD;
enterprise. This &lt;em>connectivity&lt;/em> cannot be understood, optimized, implemented and managed properly without the&#xD;
creation of abstract models. These models support the decision making required to evolve the enterprise's information&#xD;
technology that it turn supports the goals of the organization.</usageGuidance>

    The purpose of this reference process is to provide the activities and tasks for following the Unified Architecture&#xD;

    As illustrated in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../UAM/guidances/roadmaps/uam_ad_governance_D3C747FE.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0TknkGjpEeS7ieerwXbTqg&quot;>Roadmap: AD&#xD;
    Governance&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;it is recommended that the enterprise have a single Enterprise (Chief IT) Architect plus a Business&#xD;
    Line (Domain) Architect for each business line. Enterprise-wide standards and guidance will be provided and managed by&#xD;
    the Enterprise Architect, while the Domain (Business Line) Architects do the same for their portion of the enterprise.&#xD;
    It is likely that IT architectural issues are quite different in each business line,&amp;nbsp;but this will&#xD;
    be&amp;nbsp;dependent upon the size and type of business. This architectural governance structure also has clear spans of&#xD;
    control, with enterprise-wide issue being the responsibility of the Enterprise Architect. A typical, reasonably sized&#xD;
    enterprise, will therefore likely have:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Enterprise Architect&lt;/strong> - responsible for the overall enterprise IT structure and standards;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Corporate Domain Architect&lt;/strong> - responsible for the network infrastructure, common services (e.g.,&#xD;
        email, web, etc.), and corporate applications (e.g., HR systems, Financial COTS systems, etc.);&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Line Architect&lt;/strong> - responsible for the architecture of business-line specific systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>Thus, there are typically two basic architects (i.e., Enterprise and Corporate), plus an IT architect for each&#xD;
business line if the size of the enterprise warrants it.&lt;br /></howtoStaff>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    IT Architecture sometimes drives, or is driven by, the need for transformation within the business. But more often, it&#xD;
    is done to clarify the long-term (strategic) goals of the enterprise as reflected by and supported by information&#xD;
    technology. The architecture process may be focused on one of the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Transformation of the business (i.e., Business Process Reengineering) captured in an IT architecture;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Consolidation of IT (information technology) services into a normalized set;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Addition of new capabilities to an existing business process;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definition of new business process(es);&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definition of a new IT environment in support of strategic business goals;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definition of enterprise or business domain architectural IT standards.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This list is by no means complete. There are many reasons for doing IT architecture. The techniques here may also be&#xD;
    applied to all aspects of the enterprise IT, including those that support IT requirements (e.g., network monitoring and&#xD;
    management functions for example).&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></scope>
    <usageNotes>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The delivery process allows for many parallel activities, since there may be multiple strategies&amp;nbsp;underway,&#xD;
    and&amp;nbsp;multiple enterprise or business domain level projects underway. Also, Architectural Decisions may arise at&#xD;
    anytime and anywhere within the enterprise. A separate governance process has been defined for Architectural Decisions:&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../UAM/guidances/roadmaps/uam_ad_governance_D3C747FE.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_0TknkGjpEeS7ieerwXbTqg&quot;>Roadmap: AD Governance&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    UAM has governance processes incorporated into its Delivery Processes, including architectural assessments, and&#xD;
    milestone reviews. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../UAM/deliveryprocesses/uam_it_architecture_del_8B27C350.html&quot; guid=&quot;_M6m4MchNEdyU89e0dKAsrw&quot;>Delivery&#xD;
    Process: IT Architecture Delivery&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However, each enterprise has its own governance processes for the business and associated IT systems. A separate&#xD;
    generic governance process has been defined within UAM that specifies where and how to integrate UAM within these&#xD;
    pre-existing enterprise processes. See:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

develop a migration plan to a target architecture (&lt;em>to-be&lt;/em> architecture) the existing environment (&lt;em>as-is&lt;/em>&#xD;

    The purpose is to ensure that there is cohesion and agreement in the models, from the architecture perspective and get&#xD;
    agreement from stakeholders. And to also generally improve the quality of the architecture and the architects through&#xD;
    the provision of feedback.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once an IT architecture perspective is completed, two types of reviews are undertaken:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>peer review&lt;/em> of the results is done prior to moving on to next steps, which focuses on the&#xD;
        consistency, completeness and cohesiveness of the architecture. This review is done at the end of the development&#xD;
        of the perspective, for example: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../UAM/deliveryprocesses/uam_business_milestone_78D9E3AB.html&quot; guid=&quot;_Uw7RMN5nEdyg17nU3bVmlA&quot;>Milestone:&#xD;
        Business Perspective Milestone&lt;/a>.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A second phase, the &lt;em>stakeholder review&lt;/em> described here, focuses on the content of the architecture in terms&#xD;
        of how accurately it captures the business, which normally involves a number of stakeholders that have intimate&#xD;
        knowledge of the area of the business in question, and at the correct level, namely Business, Logical&amp;nbsp;or&#xD;
        Technical.&amp;nbsp;This is the final &quot;approval&quot; step for the IT architecture perspective.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These reviews document deficiencies, errors and omissions in a &quot;Review Record&quot;, which the architect then actions (i.e.,&#xD;
    models etc. are updated or changed as needed). The recommended next steps are also identified for later approval and&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this activity is to create an Architecture Decision (AD), specifically to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the context of the problem, issue or decision;&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the constraints, imposed by existing architecture, enterprise standards or others;&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the rationale for the decision, through a well researched summary of the facts;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Extract the implications of the AD, on current systems, future systems, support aspects and other aspects;&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the specifics of the decision.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity results in the production of an AD. The diagram illustrates the main inputs and outputs of this activity&#xD;
    as hinted at above. A problem context helps to define the scope of the AD, and the constraints (imposed by technology,&#xD;
    the current situation, etc.) along with the rational (that is very much local to the business and the context) help in&#xD;
    arriving at and defining the decision. Implications of this decision, on the business and the current situation, are&#xD;
    also extracted and defined.&#xD;

    The three possible triggers for updates (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;business change, technology change or problem)&amp;nbsp;are integrated&#xD;
    into the process. The included activities for all possible paths are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Determine Solution &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Impact&lt;/strong> – a solution to a problem is agreed and defined, and then the&#xD;
        impact is determined in terms of the models requiring updates. Impacts to Business models will require updates to&#xD;
        all perspectives; impacts to Logical models will also require updates to the Technical models.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Analyze Impact and Opportunity&lt;/strong> – the (potential) introduction of new technology to the enterprise&#xD;
        may have widespread impacts. These are analyzed to determine if the impact is either just to the Logical&#xD;
        perspective or the Technology perspective (or perhaps no impact at all), or it has an impact at the business level.&#xD;
        Business level impacts require a different approach, not just a simple update to the business models. The impact&#xD;
        may be simplification or alteration of business processes, or it may require or provide the opportunity for a new&#xD;
        approach, or even a new business line or division (i.e., a new product or service). The impact level and&#xD;
        opportunity is defined and agreed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Update Business Models&lt;/strong> – the business perspective is updated as required by the business change or&#xD;
        issue resolution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Update Logical Models&lt;/strong> – the logical perspective is updated as required by the business change or&#xD;
        issue resolution and the changes to the business model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Update Technical Models&lt;/strong> – the technical perspective is updated as required by the business change&#xD;
        or issue resolution and the changes to the business and logical models.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Update Migration Plan&lt;/strong> – migration plans are always updated once changes to the architecture are&#xD;
        completed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition, the updated IT architecture may then be &lt;em>used&lt;/em> within enterprise IT management processes to aid in&#xD;
    planning and migration. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <keyConsiderations>If the change is minor enough, as specified by the enteprise's management parameters, then this process will not be&#xD;
necessary, but existing IT architectures will have the minor updates applied. However, if the impact on the IT architecture&#xD;
is substantial then this process is necessary to ensure that the IT architecture remains current and up-to-date.</keyConsiderations>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The need for maintenance of an IT architecture centers around three separate drivers for change:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An update to the business (i.e., strategy, plans, products, services, etc.);&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An update to the technology used, or proposed to be used;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identification of a problem with the existing architecture or operational system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each of these drivers is addressed within the defined delivery process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the change is minor enough, as specified by the enteprise's management parameters, then this process will not be&#xD;
    necessary, but existing IT architectures will have the minor updates applied. However, if the impact on the IT&#xD;
    architecture is substantial then this process is necessary to ensure that the IT architecture remains current and&#xD;

    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To develop a migration plan the current environment is compared with a target architecture (a gap analysis is done) and&#xD;
    the differences noted. Knowledge of dependencies between components, technologies, processes and systems, among other&#xD;
    aspects, is then used to order these steps into a logical sequence of activities, with the end result being the&#xD;
    enterprise's environment ending up in the target state as defined by the target enterprise architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the case of an update, the gap analysis may be a comparison of the old target architecture with the new target&#xD;
    architecture. This will simplify the analysis and speed up the update process, but only if the update was not&#xD;
    substantial.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the migration plan is updated, it is then up to the organization, through its management and planning processes,&#xD;
    to execute based upon this plan. Each enterprise has its own governance processes; for the business and for the&#xD;
    associated IT systems. A separate generic governance process has been defined within UAM that specifies where and how&#xD;
    to integrate UAM within these pre-existing enterprise management&amp;nbsp;processes. This &quot;Delivery Process&quot; is to be&#xD;
    adapted and integrated into the enteprise's processes. See:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Technical level is defined/updated in an iterative manner. Note that&amp;nbsp;IT architectures are typically focused on&#xD;
    and driven by:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>The Business&lt;/strong> - the organization and its products and services;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Technology&lt;/strong> - the technology that supports the business typically has a large impact on the IT&#xD;
        architecture.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Technical level architectures are typically centered upon specific technology choices and patterns. Generic choices&#xD;
    made at the Logical level likely affected business process definitions, now the detailed influences&amp;nbsp;of the&#xD;
    technologies chosen are addressed.&amp;nbsp;Also important at the Technical level are the choices around IT security an&#xD;
    also the Actor/Roles model and how the user interface supports end-to-end business processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Approval to proceed with this update has been granted, but stakeholders need to be involved to ensure that the&#xD;

    Existing Architecture Analysis is the process of leveraging existing architectural assets (e.g. existing architecture&#xD;
    definitions within the enterprise) as well as industry or enterprise standards, models and assets in order speed up the&#xD;
    definition of a new IT architecture. Using&amp;nbsp;this bottom-up approach, Existing Architecture Analysis identifies and&#xD;
    validates candidate roles, functions, entities, locations&amp;nbsp;and flows. Technical constraints related to existing&#xD;
    systems should also be evaluated, again for speeding up the architecture process and for risk management&#xD;
    purposes.&amp;nbsp;Analyzing technical and enterprise (AD)&amp;nbsp;constraints should be done early in this analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If an Architectural Summary has already been defined, then this task (following the steps defined below) updates it&#xD;
    based upon the new and revised IT Architecture models.&#xD;

        A second phase, the &lt;em>stakeholder review&lt;/em> described here, focuses on the content of the architecture in terms&#xD;
        of how accurately it captures the business, which normally involves a number of stakeholders that have intimate&#xD;
        knowledge of the area of the business in question, and at the correct level, namely Business, Logical&amp;nbsp;or&#xD;
        Technical.&amp;nbsp;This is the final &quot;approval&quot; step for the IT architecture perspective.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These reviews document deficiencies, errors and omissions in a &quot;Review Record&quot;, which the architect then actions (i.e.,&#xD;
    models etc. are updated or changed as needed). The recommended next steps are also identified for later approval and&#xD;

    <usageGuidance>An architectural decision may be defined at any time during the development of an architecture, a project, during business&#xD;
planning and in many other situations. This is an on-going activity.</usageGuidance>
    <purpose>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Delivery__Architectural_Decision&quot; name=&quot;XE_Delivery__Architectural_Decision&quot;>&lt;/a>The purpose of this activity is&#xD;
to define an Architectural Decision and get it approved and published. Documenting important decisions provides a&#xD;
repository (of decisions) that will help guide other architects, managers, and implementers in being compliant with&#xD;
enterprise and business domain standards. They also provide a source of information for re-visiting decisions over time.</purpose>

    This activity results in the production of an AD. The diagram illustrates the main inputs and outputs of this activity&#xD;
    as hinted at above. A problem context helps to define the scope of the AD, and the constraints (imposed by technology,&#xD;
    the current situation, etc.) along with the rational (that is very much local to the business and the context) help in&#xD;
    arriving at and defining the decision. Implications of this decision, on the business and the current situation, are&#xD;
    also extracted and defined.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>This approach should only be followed if there is real urgency, since many valuable steps are skipped or analysis is&#xD;
limited&amp;nbsp;and therefore detail will be missing from the final result. It's a question of balancing the risk of not&#xD;
completing the architecture in time versus leaving out important analysis that may come back to cause problems down the&#xD;
road.</keyConsiderations>
    <usageGuidance>Typically a simple Technology Perspective is defined to document an existing architecture, since this development is done&#xD;
bottom-up.</usageGuidance>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This simplified approach to producing an architecture does not come without a cost. Important analysis is not done, and&#xD;
    therefore detail will be missing or aspects not examined properly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This approach is faster because it leverages existing information such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Documentation on existing systems;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enterprise or industry architectural patterns.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This approach simplifies the documentation required for the architecture, namely fewer models and simpler models. The&#xD;
    &quot;simple&quot; IT architecture is typically focused on one or two aspects; &lt;em>Location&lt;/em> for example, to re-architect the&#xD;
    IP network.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>: Simple models are only defined at the Logical or Technical level since existing&#xD;
    documentation may not include the business level, and the focus is at the Logical or Technical levels due to the&#xD;
    urgency and time constraints placed on the project.&#xD;

    If the business analysis is well understood by all stakeholders and the project team, the benefits of developing a&#xD;
    Business Entity Model are significantly diminished, however, this is rarely the case. Where this occurs, the Business&#xD;
    Entity Model may be sparsely defined. However, it is usually wise to develop a complete model to improve understanding&#xD;
    of the way the business activities work with and use the business entities.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    One&amp;nbsp;can choose to develop an &quot;incomplete&quot; Business Entity Model, focusing on explaining &quot;things&quot; important only to&#xD;
    a particular business domain or activity in question. Such a model does not include the complete information content of&#xD;
    the &quot;system&quot;. This model is useful for providing a common basis with which concepts can be clarified and defined, while&#xD;
    limiting scope and effort. Core entities should be included along with business entities having direct relationships to&#xD;
    the core to provide context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;em>As-Is&lt;/em> Model vs. &lt;em>To-Be&lt;/em> Model&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is to do business re-engineering, one should consider building two&#xD;
    variants of the Business Entity Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisaged new target&#xD;
    situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current versions of the Business Entity Model is simply an inventory of existing data models, but brought up to a&#xD;
    (conceptual) high-level. The entities of the model are not described in any detail. Typically brief descriptions are&#xD;
    sufficient. The target version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be&#xD;
    reconsidered and aligned with the new business strategy and goals.&#xD;

    The Business Roles Model is a way of expressing the Business Activities&amp;nbsp;interacted with by&amp;nbsp;Actors. Actors are&#xD;

    modeled. Business Activities in this context equate to &quot;business interactions&quot;, which will be detailed more at the&#xD;
    Logical and Technical levels. Note that only Actors are defined at the Business level since defining Roles requires&#xD;
    that a &quot;automate&quot; vs. &quot;manual&quot; decision to be made, which is not done at the Business level; this is left to the&#xD;
    Logical level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (and the user level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, but only starting at the Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information&#xD;
    / services may be controlled based upon a user's Role). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Business Actors and&#xD;
    the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process analysts&#xD;
    and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by systems&#xD;
    analysts and software architects to provide context for software development.&lt;/span>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Entities represent an abstraction of important (typically persistent) information within the business. Any&#xD;
    piece of information that is a property of something else is probably not a Business Entity in itself.&amp;nbsp; For&#xD;
    example, &lt;em>ContactDetails&lt;/em> is a property of &lt;em>Customer&lt;/em> and therefore not a Business Entity in itself.&#xD;
    Information that is not stored but is created or determined on-demand (when necessary) is also probably not a Business&#xD;
    Entity. For example, product inventory numbers is certainly significant information, but this is not persistent&#xD;
    information. Any time somebody needs to know how many instances of a particular bar code are currently on the shelves&#xD;
    (or in the warehouse), this information will be calculated and then discarded. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Business Entities, as well as for assessing the impact of organizational changes on the information created and&#xD;

    are high-level conceptualizations of the Roles with the system; further analysis is required to fully understand and&#xD;
    define required roles. A role can be assumed (aggregated) by any kind of actor, either human or a system. An actor may&#xD;
    be aggregate multiple roles, and an actor can be associated with multiple physical people (or systems). Roles also&#xD;
    include security concepts and constructs. An employee of the enterprise is typically multiple actors with the system&#xD;
    and therefore has many different roles.&#xD;

    If the business analysis is well understood by all stakeholders and the project team, the benefits of developing a&#xD;
    Business Entity Model are significantly diminished, however, this is rarely the case. Where this occurs, the Business&#xD;
    Entity Model may be sparsely defined. However, it is usually wise to develop a complete model to improve understanding&#xD;
    of the way the business activities work with and use the business entities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Business_Perspective__Business_Entity_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Business_Perspective__Business_Entity_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One&amp;nbsp;can choose to develop an &quot;incomplete&quot; Business Entity Model, focusing on explaining &quot;things&quot; important only to&#xD;
    a particular business domain or activity in question. Such a model does not include the complete information content of&#xD;
    the &quot;system&quot;. This model is useful for providing a common basis with which concepts can be clarified and defined, while&#xD;
    limiting scope and effort. Core entities should be included along with business entities having direct relationships to&#xD;
    the core to provide context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;em>As-Is&lt;/em> Model vs. &lt;em>To-Be&lt;/em> Model&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is to do business re-engineering, one should consider building two&#xD;
    variants of the Business Entity Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisaged new target&#xD;
    situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current versions of the Business Entity Model is simply an inventory of existing data models, but brought up to a&#xD;
    (conceptual) high-level. The entities of the model are not described in any detail. Typically brief descriptions are&#xD;
    sufficient. The target version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be&#xD;
    reconsidered and aligned with the new business strategy and goals.&#xD;

    A Business Roles Model is created (at least a subset) very early during the architecture development, and fully&#xD;
    detailed and adjusted as the architecture progresses. This artifact is enclosed within the Business Perspective&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Roles Model is a way of expressing the Business Activities&amp;nbsp;interacted with by&amp;nbsp;Actors. Actors are&#xD;
    conceptual at the highest level. The types of Actors and interactions they have with Business Activities are what are&#xD;
    modeled. Business Activities in this context equate to &quot;business interactions&quot;, which will be detailed more at the&#xD;
    Logical and Technical levels. Note that only Actors are defined at the Business level since defining Roles requires&#xD;
    that a &quot;automate&quot; vs. &quot;manual&quot; decision to be made, which is not done at the Business level; this is left to the&#xD;
    Logical level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (and the user level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, but only starting at the Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information&#xD;
    / services may be controlled based upon a user's Role). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Business Actors and&#xD;
    the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process analysts&#xD;
    and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by systems&#xD;
    analysts and software architects to provide context for software development.&lt;/span>&#xD;

    A role is played in relation to the business by someone or something in the business environment. A role is equated or&#xD;
    defined by the behavior (and by extension its responsibilities) that it interacts with in the system — the activities&#xD;
    that it interacts with. A role is in essence the “interface” to the activities with which it interacts. Business Roles&#xD;
    are high-level conceptualizations of the Roles with the system; further analysis is required to fully understand and&#xD;
    define required roles. A role can be assumed (aggregated) by any kind of actor, either human or a system. An actor may&#xD;
    be aggregate multiple roles, and an actor can be associated with multiple physical people (or systems). Roles also&#xD;
    include security concepts and constructs. An employee of the enterprise is typically multiple actors with the system&#xD;
    and therefore has many different roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore Roles are a categorization, based upon specific interactions with the system ... the interfaces.&amp;nbsp;These&#xD;
    interfaces may eventually be defined as&amp;nbsp;either human (i.e. GUIs) or as interfaces with other systems.&#xD;

    Business Entities represent an abstraction of important (typically persistent) information within the business. Any&#xD;
    piece of information that is a property of something else is probably not a Business Entity in itself.&amp;nbsp; For&#xD;

    Information that is not stored but is created or determined on-demand (when necessary) is also probably not a Business&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Entity Model defines a logical data model for the enterprise or system, as defined by the scope of the&#xD;
    modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define the entities involved, and the relationships between them needed to&#xD;
    support the defined logical processes. The definition must be valid for the defined scope, and must eliminate any&#xD;
    ambiguity regarding what they represent.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Relationships between entities are derived directly from analysis of the business, its activities and processes. Two&#xD;
    main aspects are important, the relationships supporting the business processes and functions, and the relationships&#xD;
    supporting the monitoring and management of the business. Note that generalizations, aggregations and other types of&#xD;
    analysis are added at this logical level. All attributes of the entities should be defined along with candidate keys&#xD;
    and identities for each if desired.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The logical actors and logical roles that work with these entities are also identified if desired. The structure of&#xD;
    defined actors and roles, along with their relationships to entities, is used to identify the access controls aspect of&#xD;
    IT security required. This part of the model is derived from and uses elements from other views, such as the Logical&#xD;
    Process Model and the Logical Roles Model, which illustrates how intertwined and dependent the viewpoints are within&#xD;
    UAM, or any architecture for that matter. See the Logical Process Model and Logical Roles Model definitions for more&#xD;
    detail regarding these derived relationships to Logical Roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The entities along with relationships, represent a logical model of the entities. This model should evolve quickly and&#xD;
    may remain fluid for some time as different representations and their implications are explored. Formal documentation&#xD;
    can impede this process, so be careful how much energy you expend on maintaining this 'model' in a formal&#xD;
    sense.&amp;nbsp;Don't spend a&amp;nbsp;lot of time polishing the model, which my be expendable, until it is stable. The&#xD;
    entities, if chosen carefully will survive into the&amp;nbsp;Technical level relatively unchanged. However, some of them&#xD;
    may represent whole collaborations of objects, often encapsulated by subsystems in the Technical model, and certainly&#xD;
    when a project is instantiated to implement&amp;nbsp;the system then a lot more analysis will be done and detail added,&#xD;
    which will likely result in much re-factoring of the model at the very least.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;em>As-Is&lt;/em> Model vs. &lt;em>To-Be&lt;/em> Model&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the modeling effort is to do business re-engineering, one should consider building two variants of&#xD;
    the Logical Entity Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisaged new target situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current versions of the Logical Entity Model is compared to the target version to identify changes. The target&#xD;
    version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be reconsidered and aligned&#xD;
    with the new business strategy and goals.&#xD;

    The Logical Locations viewpoint describes the structure of locations (each of which contain activities, roles, and&#xD;
    processes) that when structured into a model define the complete set of locations, and their interrelationships, at&#xD;
    which the system under study operates. At the logical level locations are abstracted, likely into types of locations.&#xD;
    For example a bank operates at many locations, but each one can be abstracted into Logical Locations such as Head&#xD;
    Office, Main Branch, Branch, Full Service ATM, and ATM among others.&#xD;

    example; at this level some of these defined &quot;locations&quot; may include security domains and zones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    locations, based upon the technical (business) functions supported, with having processes and services that are under&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Roles viewpoint defines the roles, at the logical level, involved in and important to the defined business&#xD;
    processes. The roles implemented by the logical systems are incorporated into the model, optionally including&#xD;
    relationships to business functions (activities) involved with the role. Roles have a direct relationship to user&#xD;
    interactions with the system. That is, for every role users have within a system, there is a set of activities&#xD;
    (defining a business process) that include the user interfaces (show as User Tasks). Security is thus an important&#xD;
    aspect of this model as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus of the roles model is on all interactions with the business processes and activities, with the Logical Roles&#xD;
    representing the “interface protocol” (in the case of system interactions: Service Tasks) or “graphical user interface”&#xD;
    (GUI, in the case of human interactions: User Tasks) to the Logical Activities and Processes. At the Technical level&#xD;
    these definitions are not implementable but will clearly specify the required structure and content for these&#xD;
    interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the context of IT architecture and the Logical Roles Viewpoint, the Activities within this model do not represent&#xD;
    the complete business Activity, just the presentation layer or interface. These Logical Activities therefore represent&#xD;
    the boundary portion of the Logical Process Model—the Logical Process Model captures all Processes, Activities and&#xD;
    Tasks, but with the interface/GUI portion also being represented in the Logical Roles Model through a User Task (or&#xD;
    Service Task for system interactions). The Logical Roles Model is incomplete from a process perspective; therefore the&#xD;
    Logical Process Model defines the complete business solution for Processes and Activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Logical Roles Model is created&amp;nbsp;very early during the architecture development, and fully detailed and adjusted&#xD;
    as the architecture progresses. This artifact is enclosed within the Logical Perspective artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (at the &lt;em>user&lt;/em> level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, starting now at this Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information /&#xD;
    services may be controlled based upon a user's Role: RBAC). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Logical Actors&#xD;
    and the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process&#xD;
    analysts and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by&#xD;
    systems analysts and software architects to provide context for software development and GUI designs.&lt;/span>&#xD;

    A&amp;nbsp;Logical Role that is equated to or defined by the behavior (and by extension its responsibilities) that it&#xD;
    interacts with in the system—the activities that it interacts with. A role is in essence the “interface” to the&#xD;
    activities with which it interacts. A role can be assumed (aggregated) by any kind of actor, either human or a system&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Logical roles are identified early in the process of modeling a business. It is not a simple user-to-role analysis. The&#xD;
    same role can be played by multiple users (people), and a user may assume multiple roles during their interaction with&#xD;
    the systems of the business. Analysis of these interactions must be done in order to categorize them into the various&#xD;
    roles. The benefit is a simplification of the user interface required to be implemented to support the various users.&#xD;

    There is an extensive&amp;nbsp;project process defined within enterprises. This involves the creation and review of a&#xD;
    number of&amp;nbsp;artifacts that the IT architect needs to review, as summarized in the figure below.&#xD;

    In support of the &quot;Review Architecture&quot; activities the required set of documentation is gathered. The basic&#xD;
    documentation needed are the defined IT architecture view, the sets of models to be reviewed. Ancillary information is&#xD;
    also gathered such as requirements, scope, strategy and planning documents associated with the IT architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The set of documentation gathered together (from the list below) for any given review&amp;nbsp;is dependent upon the level&#xD;

    The enterprise that owns the Architectural Decisions will need to decide how they are to be classified and organized&#xD;
    for easy search and retrieval by&amp;nbsp;architects, designers and implementation people. Although the creation and&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    ADs contain a lot of background and substantiating information. This is very useful if the decision needs to be&#xD;
    re-visited in the future, however, most users of this information (i.e., architects, project managers, and&#xD;
    implementers) are only interested in the decision itself. Therefore when a set of applicable (to an&#xD;
    IT&amp;nbsp;architecture project) ADs is found, a summary report should be provided to the user of the repository that&#xD;
    defines each decision, leaving out all of the extraneous supporting information. The specific AD can be examined in&#xD;
    total if more information is required.&#xD;

    Actors are a categorization, based upon required interactions, of external interactions with the system.&amp;nbsp;At the&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;

        &lt;b>Business analysts&lt;/b>, when defining the boundaries of the organization and required processes;&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Logical Actor can be equated to the external people or systems that interact with the system under study. Actors are&#xD;
    not necessarily external to the business; they may also represent internal “user” interactions with the system. Logical&#xD;
    Actors are high-level conceptualizations of the Actors with the system; further analysis is required to fully&#xD;
    understand and define required actors. Note that actors are not individuals nor are they necessarily equivalent to job&#xD;
    titles; instead, they describe the behavior in the enterprise and the responsibilities of the associated “user”.&#xD;

    The important things to specify are the system-wide or corporate-wide definitions for the elements within this model.&#xD;
    Element relationships are very important since they related directly to how the entities are used and need to be used&#xD;
    to support the business. Likewise the structure of the information is important—it must also support the business both&#xD;
    present and future.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Technical Roles Model has at this level flushed out some important structures and relationships as well. See the&#xD;
    definition for the Technical Roles Model below and how it supports Processes and their required access to Entities.&#xD;

    A Technical Entity is a representation of the information and data used within the system being modeled. At the&#xD;
    technical level a very complete view of the data entities are defined, including their attributes and relationships. If&#xD;
    desired, primary keys and other structural information may also be included. Technical Entities are used to define a&#xD;
    physical data model in support of the processes and activities of the system, but perhaps not to the level of detail&#xD;
    required for implementation (depending upon the context and objectives of the architecture effort). This element&#xD;
    provides the ability to manage complexity in architectures through the definition of hierarchical models.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Technical Locations Viewpoint is used, within the enterprise architecture context, to either specify technical&#xD;
    patterns for the enterprise, or if the scope, scale and resources are appropriate to document a physical&#xD;
    (near-implementation) level view of enterprise locations. Both may be described, if desired and appropriate, as well.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The locations viewpoint&amp;nbsp;is a key element of the Technical Perspective. It may be used to show how entities (data),&#xD;
    processes and the network aspects (and the required supporting infrastructure) are organized and deployed throughout&#xD;
    the system (or enterprise). In other words, some entity model, process model and roles model aspects may be shown to&#xD;
    best advantage in the locations model. Partitioning and layering is used to separate these aspects in the locations&#xD;
    model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The locations model works best if layering is used to deal with complexity and to provide views appropriate for the&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In UAM the primary purpose of modeling Roles and Actors is to describe how the activities are interacted with by&#xD;
    various internal and external users, and most importantly by its customers and partners. All interactions of Roles and&#xD;
    Actors (both internal and external) with activities are defined; therefore employees that interact with activities and&#xD;
    process are also modeled.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Technical_Perspective__Technical_Roles_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Technical_Perspective__Technical_Roles_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus of the roles model is on all interactions with the business processes and activities, with the Technical&#xD;
    Roles representing the “interface protocol” (in the case of system interactions: Service Tasks) or “graphical user&#xD;
    interface” (GUI, in the case of human interactions: User Tasks) to the Technical Activities and Processes. At the&#xD;
    Technical level these definitions are not implementable but will clearly specify the required structure and content for&#xD;
    these interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the context of IT architecture and the Technical Roles Viewpoint, the Activities within this model do not represent&#xD;
    the complete business Activity, just the presentation layer or interface. These Technical Activities therefore&#xD;
    represent the boundary portion of the Technical Process Model—the Technical Process Model captures all Processes,&#xD;
    Activities and Tasks, but with the interface/GUI portion also being represented in the Technical Roles Model through a&#xD;
    User Task (or Service Task for system interactions). The Technical Roles Model is incomplete from a process&#xD;
    perspective; therefore the Technical Process Model defines the complete business solution for Processes and&#xD;
    Activities.&lt;br />&#xD;

    the organization. They provide instructions, and constraints, for IT managers and experts when deciding on solutions&#xD;
    and investments.&amp;nbsp;The strategy is typically written down in a document. Also see: &lt;a&#xD; 
    href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_strategy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; >Wikipedia 2014&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_IT_Strategy&quot; name=&quot;XE_IT_Strategy&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Strategy defines the general direction that the enterprise is taking with respect to technology—some high-level&#xD;
    technology choices are defined. It should also have an assessment of general technology directions—indications of where&#xD;
    technology is going in the future and how the enterprise is to use it to advantage.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Strategy defines constraints on the IT architecture that have to be addressed.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Technical Actor can be equated to the external people or systems that interact with the system under study. Actors&#xD;
    are not necessarily external to the business; they may also represent internal “user” interactions with the system.&#xD;
    Technical Actors are conceptualizations of the Actors with the system; further analysis is required to fully understand&#xD;
    and define required actors. Note that actors are not individuals nor are they necessarily equivalent to job titles;&#xD;
    instead, they describe the behavior in the enterprise and the responsibilities of the associated “user”.&#xD;

    If the business analysis is well understood by all stakeholders and the project team, the benefits of developing a&#xD;
    Business Entity Model are significantly diminished, however, this is rarely the case. Where this occurs, the Business&#xD;
    Entity Model may be sparsely defined. However, it is usually wise to develop a complete model to improve understanding&#xD;
    of the way the business activities work with and use the business entities.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    One&amp;nbsp;can choose to develop an &quot;incomplete&quot; Business Entity Model, focusing on explaining &quot;things&quot; important only to&#xD;
    a particular business domain or activity in question. Such a model does not include the complete information content of&#xD;
    the &quot;system&quot;. This model is useful for providing a common basis with which concepts can be clarified and defined, while&#xD;
    limiting scope and effort. Core entities should be included along with business entities having direct relationships to&#xD;
    the core to provide context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;em>As-Is&lt;/em> Model vs. &lt;em>To-Be&lt;/em> Model&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is to do business re-engineering, one should consider building two&#xD;
    variants of the Business Entity Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisaged new target&#xD;
    situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current versions of the Business Entity Model is simply an inventory of existing data models, but brought up to a&#xD;
    (conceptual) high-level. The entities of the model are not described in any detail. Typically brief descriptions are&#xD;
    sufficient. The target version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be&#xD;
    reconsidered and aligned with the new business strategy and goals.&#xD;

    Entity. For example, product inventory numbers is certainly significant information, but this is not persistent&#xD;
    information. Any time somebody needs to know how many instances of a particular bar code are currently on the shelves&#xD;
    (or in the warehouse), this information will be calculated and then discarded. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Logical and Technical levels. Note that only Actors are defined at the Business level since defining Roles requires&#xD;
    that a &quot;automate&quot; vs. &quot;manual&quot; decision to be made, which is not done at the Business level; this is left to the&#xD;
    Logical level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (and the user level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, but only starting at the Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information&#xD;
    / services may be controlled based upon a user's Role). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Business Actors and&#xD;
    the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process analysts&#xD;
    and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by systems&#xD;
    analysts and software architects to provide context for software development.&lt;/span>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A role is played in relation to the business by someone or something in the business environment. A role is equated or&#xD;
    defined by the behavior (and by extension its responsibilities) that it interacts with in the system — the activities&#xD;
    that it interacts with. A role is in essence the “interface” to the activities with which it interacts. Business Roles&#xD;
    are high-level conceptualizations of the Roles with the system; further analysis is required to fully understand and&#xD;
    define required roles. A role can be assumed (aggregated) by any kind of actor, either human or a system. An actor may&#xD;
    be aggregate multiple roles, and an actor can be associated with multiple physical people (or systems). Roles also&#xD;
    include security concepts and constructs. An employee of the enterprise is typically multiple actors with the system&#xD;
    and therefore has many different roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore Roles are a categorization, based upon specific interactions with the system ... the interfaces.&amp;nbsp;These&#xD;
    interfaces may eventually be defined as&amp;nbsp;either human (i.e. GUIs) or as interfaces with other systems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>NOTE&lt;/strong>: Roles are not defined at the Business level, but they may be rolled back into the Business&#xD;
    Perspective once defined at the Logical Perspective, in order to facilitate a more complete descriptions for business&#xD;
    stakeholders.&#xD;

    A Business Actor can be equated to the external people or systems that interact with the system under study. Actors are&#xD;
    not necessarily external to the business; they may also represent internal “user” interactions with the system.&#xD;
    Business Actors are high-level conceptualizations of the Actors with the system; further analysis is required to fully&#xD;
    understand and define required actors. Note that actors are not individuals nor are they necessarily equivalent to job&#xD;
    titles; instead, they describe the behavior in the enterprise and the responsibilities of the associated “user”.&#xD;

    If the business analysis is well understood by all stakeholders and the project team, the benefits of developing a&#xD;
    Business Entity Model are significantly diminished, however, this is rarely the case. Where this occurs, the Business&#xD;
    Entity Model may be sparsely defined. However, it is usually wise to develop a complete model to improve understanding&#xD;

    the &quot;system&quot;. This model is useful for providing a common basis with which concepts can be clarified and defined, while&#xD;
    limiting scope and effort. Core entities should be included along with business entities having direct relationships to&#xD;
    the core to provide context.&#xD;

    situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    The current versions of the Business Entity Model is simply an inventory of existing data models, but brought up to a&#xD;
    (conceptual) high-level. The entities of the model are not described in any detail. Typically brief descriptions are&#xD;
    sufficient. The target version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Entity Model defines a logical data model for the enterprise or system, as defined by the scope of the&#xD;
    modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define the entities involved, and the relationships between them needed to&#xD;
    support the defined logical processes. The definition must be valid for the defined scope, and must eliminate any&#xD;
    ambiguity regarding what they represent.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Relationships between entities are derived directly from analysis of the business, its activities and processes. Two&#xD;
    main aspects are important, the relationships supporting the business processes and functions, and the relationships&#xD;
    supporting the monitoring and management of the business. Note that generalizations, aggregations and other types of&#xD;
    analysis are added at this logical level. All attributes of the entities should be defined along with candidate keys&#xD;
    and identities for each if desired.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The logical actors and logical roles that work with these entities are also identified if desired. The structure of&#xD;
    defined actors and roles, along with their relationships to entities, is used to identify the access controls aspect of&#xD;
    IT security required. This part of the model is derived from and uses elements from other views, such as the Logical&#xD;
    Process Model and the Logical Roles Model, which illustrates how intertwined and dependent the viewpoints are within&#xD;
    UAM, or any architecture for that matter. See the Logical Process Model and Logical Roles Model definitions for more&#xD;
    detail regarding these derived relationships to Logical Roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The entities along with relationships, represent a logical model of the entities. This model should evolve quickly and&#xD;
    may remain fluid for some time as different representations and their implications are explored. Formal documentation&#xD;
    can impede this process, so be careful how much energy you expend on maintaining this 'model' in a formal&#xD;
    sense.&amp;nbsp;Don't spend a&amp;nbsp;lot of time polishing the model, which my be expendable, until it is stable. The&#xD;
    entities, if chosen carefully will survive into the&amp;nbsp;Technical level relatively unchanged. However, some of them&#xD;
    may represent whole collaborations of objects, often encapsulated by subsystems in the Technical model, and certainly&#xD;
    when a project is instantiated to implement&amp;nbsp;the system then a lot more analysis will be done and detail added,&#xD;
    which will likely result in much re-factoring of the model at the very least.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;em>As-Is&lt;/em> Model vs. &lt;em>To-Be&lt;/em> Model&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the modeling effort is to do business re-engineering, one should consider building two variants of&#xD;
    the Logical Entity Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisaged new target situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current versions of the Logical Entity Model is compared to the target version to identify changes. The target&#xD;
    version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be reconsidered and aligned&#xD;
    with the new business strategy and goals.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Roles viewpoint defines the roles, at the logical level, involved in and important to the defined business&#xD;
    processes. The roles implemented by the logical systems are incorporated into the model, optionally including&#xD;
    relationships to business functions (activities) involved with the role. Roles have a direct relationship to user&#xD;
    interactions with the system. That is, for every role users have within a system, there is a set of activities&#xD;
    (defining a business process) that include the user interfaces (show as User Tasks). Security is thus an important&#xD;
    aspect of this model as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus of the roles model is on all interactions with the business processes and activities, with the Logical Roles&#xD;
    representing the “interface protocol” (in the case of system interactions: Service Tasks) or “graphical user interface”&#xD;
    (GUI, in the case of human interactions: User Tasks) to the Logical Activities and Processes. At the Technical level&#xD;
    these definitions are not implementable but will clearly specify the required structure and content for these&#xD;
    interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the context of IT architecture and the Logical Roles Viewpoint, the Activities within this model do not represent&#xD;
    the complete business Activity, just the presentation layer or interface. These Logical Activities therefore represent&#xD;
    the boundary portion of the Logical Process Model—the Logical Process Model captures all Processes, Activities and&#xD;
    Tasks, but with the interface/GUI portion also being represented in the Logical Roles Model through a User Task (or&#xD;
    Service Task for system interactions). The Logical Roles Model is incomplete from a process perspective; therefore the&#xD;
    Logical Process Model defines the complete business solution for Processes and Activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Logical Roles Model is created&amp;nbsp;very early during the architecture development, and fully detailed and adjusted&#xD;
    as the architecture progresses. This artifact is enclosed within the Logical Perspective artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (at the &lt;em>user&lt;/em> level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, starting now at this Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information /&#xD;
    services may be controlled based upon a user's Role: RBAC). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Logical Actors&#xD;
    and the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process&#xD;
    analysts and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by&#xD;
    systems analysts and software architects to provide context for software development and GUI designs.&lt;/span>&#xD;

    The Business Roles Model is a way of expressing the Business Activities&amp;nbsp;interacted with by&amp;nbsp;Actors. Actors are&#xD;
    conceptual at the highest level. The types of Actors and interactions they have with Business Activities are what are&#xD;
    modeled. Business Activities in this context equate to &quot;business interactions&quot;, which will be detailed more at the&#xD;
    Logical and Technical levels. Note that only Actors are defined at the Business level since defining Roles requires&#xD;
    that a &quot;automate&quot; vs. &quot;manual&quot; decision to be made, which is not done at the Business level; this is left to the&#xD;
    Logical level.&#xD;

    which the system under study operates. At the logical level locations are abstracted, likely into types of locations.&#xD;
    For example a bank operates at many locations, but each one can be abstracted into Logical Locations such as Head&#xD;
    Office, Main Branch, Branch, Full Service ATM, and ATM among others.&#xD;

    The enterprise that owns the IT architectures needs to decide how they are to be classified and organized for easy&#xD;

    models is currently outside the scope of UAM, it is suggestion that they be organized in a widely available searchable&#xD;

    management facility, but this may limit functionality depending upon the modeling tool used.&amp;nbsp;The&#xD;

    Business Entities represent an abstraction of important (typically persistent) information within the business. Any&#xD;
    piece of information that is a property of something else is probably not a Business Entity in itself.&amp;nbsp; For&#xD;
    example, &lt;em>ContactDetails&lt;/em> is a property of &lt;em>Customer&lt;/em> and therefore not a Business Entity in itself.&#xD;
    Information that is not stored but is created or determined on-demand (when necessary) is also probably not a Business&#xD;
    Entity. For example, product inventory numbers is certainly significant information, but this is not persistent&#xD;
    information. Any time somebody needs to know how many instances of a particular bar code are currently on the shelves&#xD;
    (or in the warehouse), this information will be calculated and then discarded. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    It is very important to do architectural reviews (of all types) and to capture the results of these reviews. Often&#xD;
    errors and omissions are discovered, and these need to be captured in a way that permits them to be properly described&#xD;
    and action assigned to address them. This review typically is also the predecessor to further work: the continuation of&#xD;
    work on the architecture, or the continuation of work on maintaining or updating the IT architecture.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Entity Model defines a logical data model for the enterprise or system, as defined by the scope of the&#xD;
    modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define the entities involved, and the relationships between them needed to&#xD;
    support the defined logical processes. The definition must be valid for the defined scope, and must eliminate any&#xD;
    ambiguity regarding what they represent.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Relationships between entities are derived directly from analysis of the business, its activities and processes. Two&#xD;
    main aspects are important, the relationships supporting the business processes and functions, and the relationships&#xD;
    supporting the monitoring and management of the business. Note that generalizations, aggregations and other types of&#xD;
    analysis are added at this logical level. All attributes of the entities should be defined along with candidate keys&#xD;
    and identities for each if desired.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The logical actors and logical roles that work with these entities are also identified if desired. The structure of&#xD;
    defined actors and roles, along with their relationships to entities, is used to identify the access controls aspect of&#xD;
    IT security required. This part of the model is derived from and uses elements from other views, such as the Logical&#xD;
    Process Model and the Logical Roles Model, which illustrates how intertwined and dependent the viewpoints are within&#xD;
    UAM, or any architecture for that matter. See the Logical Process Model and Logical Roles Model definitions for more&#xD;
    detail regarding these derived relationships to Logical Roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The entities along with relationships, represent a logical model of the entities. This model should evolve quickly and&#xD;
    may remain fluid for some time as different representations and their implications are explored. Formal documentation&#xD;
    can impede this process, so be careful how much energy you expend on maintaining this 'model' in a formal&#xD;
    sense.&amp;nbsp;Don't spend a&amp;nbsp;lot of time polishing the model, which my be expendable, until it is stable. The&#xD;
    entities, if chosen carefully will survive into the&amp;nbsp;Technical level relatively unchanged. However, some of them&#xD;
    may represent whole collaborations of objects, often encapsulated by subsystems in the Technical model, and certainly&#xD;
    when a project is instantiated to implement&amp;nbsp;the system then a lot more analysis will be done and detail added,&#xD;
    which will likely result in much re-factoring of the model at the very least.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;em>As-Is&lt;/em> Model vs. &lt;em>To-Be&lt;/em> Model&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the modeling effort is to do business re-engineering, one should consider building two variants of&#xD;
    the Logical Entity Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisaged new target situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current versions of the Logical Entity Model is compared to the target version to identify changes. The target&#xD;
    version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be reconsidered and aligned&#xD;
    with the new business strategy and goals.&#xD;

    The Logical Process viewpoint defines the Activities and Processes involved in the system or enterprise, as defined by&#xD;
    the scope of the modeling effort. Depending upon the context and scope of the modeling effort, the level of detail at&#xD;
    this logical level may be quite extensive or be very broad and conceptual. It illustrates the sequence flow of the&#xD;
    Logical Activities, forming a process, along with events, gateways and actors.&amp;nbsp;It is a way of expressing the&#xD;
    business workflows through the definition of individual activities, events, gateways&amp;nbsp;and the flow between them.&#xD;

    The Logical Locations viewpoint describes the structure of locations (each of which contain activities, roles, and&#xD;
    processes) that when structured into a model define the complete set of locations, and their interrelationships, at&#xD;
    which the system under study operates. At the logical level locations are abstracted, likely into types of locations.&#xD;
    For example a bank operates at many locations, but each one can be abstracted into Logical Locations such as Head&#xD;
    Office, Main Branch, Branch, Full Service ATM, and ATM among others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Locations_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Locations_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objective is to clearly define the locations involved, and the sorts of services provided within and between them.&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding on the architecture for applications and services, so that they operate&#xD;
    effectively, over a slow speed WAN for example. Security implications are also eventually derived from this model for&#xD;
    example; at this level some of these defined &quot;locations&quot; may include security domains and zones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to clearly define the locations and the relationships between them in terms of the services&#xD;
    (activities/workflows) provided and facilities provided (data/voice, etc.).&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Roles viewpoint defines the roles, at the logical level, involved in and important to the defined business&#xD;
    processes. The roles implemented by the logical systems are incorporated into the model, optionally including&#xD;
    relationships to business functions (activities) involved with the role. Roles have a direct relationship to user&#xD;
    interactions with the system. That is, for every role users have within a system, there is a set of activities&#xD;
    (defining a business process) that include the user interfaces (show as User Tasks). Security is thus an important&#xD;
    aspect of this model as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus of the roles model is on all interactions with the business processes and activities, with the Logical Roles&#xD;
    representing the “interface protocol” (in the case of system interactions: Service Tasks) or “graphical user interface”&#xD;
    (GUI, in the case of human interactions: User Tasks) to the Logical Activities and Processes. At the Technical level&#xD;
    these definitions are not implementable but will clearly specify the required structure and content for these&#xD;
    interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the context of IT architecture and the Logical Roles Viewpoint, the Activities within this model do not represent&#xD;
    the complete business Activity, just the presentation layer or interface. These Logical Activities therefore represent&#xD;
    the boundary portion of the Logical Process Model—the Logical Process Model captures all Processes, Activities and&#xD;
    Tasks, but with the interface/GUI portion also being represented in the Logical Roles Model through a User Task (or&#xD;
    Service Task for system interactions). The Logical Roles Model is incomplete from a process perspective; therefore the&#xD;
    Logical Process Model defines the complete business solution for Processes and Activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Logical Roles Model is created&amp;nbsp;very early during the architecture development, and fully detailed and adjusted&#xD;
    as the architecture progresses. This artifact is enclosed within the Logical Perspective artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (at the &lt;em>user&lt;/em> level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, starting now at this Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information /&#xD;
    services may be controlled based upon a user's Role: RBAC). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Logical Actors&#xD;
    and the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process&#xD;
    analysts and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by&#xD;
    systems analysts and software architects to provide context for software development and GUI designs.&lt;/span>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Entity Model defines a logical data model for the enterprise or system, as defined by the scope of the&#xD;
    modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define the entities involved, and the relationships between them needed to&#xD;
    support the defined logical processes. The definition must be valid for the defined scope, and must eliminate any&#xD;
    ambiguity regarding what they represent.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Relationships between entities are derived directly from analysis of the business, its activities and processes. Two&#xD;
    main aspects are important, the relationships supporting the business processes and functions, and the relationships&#xD;
    supporting the monitoring and management of the business. Note that generalizations, aggregations and other types of&#xD;
    analysis are added at this logical level. All attributes of the entities should be defined along with candidate keys&#xD;
    and identities for each if desired.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The logical actors and logical roles that work with these entities are also identified if desired. The structure of&#xD;
    defined actors and roles, along with their relationships to entities, is used to identify the access controls aspect of&#xD;
    IT security required. This part of the model is derived from and uses elements from other views, such as the Logical&#xD;
    Process Model and the Logical Roles Model, which illustrates how intertwined and dependent the viewpoints are within&#xD;
    UAM, or any architecture for that matter. See the Logical Process Model and Logical Roles Model definitions for more&#xD;
    detail regarding these derived relationships to Logical Roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The entities along with relationships, represent a logical model of the entities. This model should evolve quickly and&#xD;
    may remain fluid for some time as different representations and their implications are explored. Formal documentation&#xD;
    can impede this process, so be careful how much energy you expend on maintaining this 'model' in a formal&#xD;
    sense.&amp;nbsp;Don't spend a&amp;nbsp;lot of time polishing the model, which my be expendable, until it is stable. The&#xD;
    entities, if chosen carefully will survive into the&amp;nbsp;Technical level relatively unchanged. However, some of them&#xD;
    may represent whole collaborations of objects, often encapsulated by subsystems in the Technical model, and certainly&#xD;
    when a project is instantiated to implement&amp;nbsp;the system then a lot more analysis will be done and detail added,&#xD;
    which will likely result in much re-factoring of the model at the very least.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;em>As-Is&lt;/em> Model vs. &lt;em>To-Be&lt;/em> Model&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the modeling effort is to do business re-engineering, one should consider building two variants of&#xD;
    the Logical Entity Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisaged new target situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current versions of the Logical Entity Model is compared to the target version to identify changes. The target&#xD;
    version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be reconsidered and aligned&#xD;
    with the new business strategy and goals.&#xD;

    The Logical Process viewpoint defines the Activities and Processes involved in the system or enterprise, as defined by&#xD;
    the scope of the modeling effort. Depending upon the context and scope of the modeling effort, the level of detail at&#xD;
    this logical level may be quite extensive or be very broad and conceptual. It illustrates the sequence flow of the&#xD;
    Logical Activities, forming a process, along with events, gateways and actors.&amp;nbsp;It is a way of expressing the&#xD;

    The Technical Entity viewpoint is not an information or data design model, but it should be fairly close. The focus is&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The important things to specify are the system-wide or corporate-wide definitions for the elements within this model.&#xD;
    Element relationships are very important since they related directly to how the entities are used and need to be used&#xD;
    to support the business. Likewise the structure of the information is important—it must also support the business both&#xD;
    present and future.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Technical Roles Model has at this level flushed out some important structures and relationships as well. See the&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Roles viewpoint defines the roles, at the logical level, involved in and important to the defined business&#xD;
    processes. The roles implemented by the logical systems are incorporated into the model, optionally including&#xD;
    relationships to business functions (activities) involved with the role. Roles have a direct relationship to user&#xD;
    interactions with the system. That is, for every role users have within a system, there is a set of activities&#xD;
    (defining a business process) that include the user interfaces (show as User Tasks). Security is thus an important&#xD;
    aspect of this model as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus of the roles model is on all interactions with the business processes and activities, with the Logical Roles&#xD;
    representing the “interface protocol” (in the case of system interactions: Service Tasks) or “graphical user interface”&#xD;
    (GUI, in the case of human interactions: User Tasks) to the Logical Activities and Processes. At the Technical level&#xD;
    these definitions are not implementable but will clearly specify the required structure and content for these&#xD;
    interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the context of IT architecture and the Logical Roles Viewpoint, the Activities within this model do not represent&#xD;
    the complete business Activity, just the presentation layer or interface. These Logical Activities therefore represent&#xD;
    the boundary portion of the Logical Process Model—the Logical Process Model captures all Processes, Activities and&#xD;
    Tasks, but with the interface/GUI portion also being represented in the Logical Roles Model through a User Task (or&#xD;
    Service Task for system interactions). The Logical Roles Model is incomplete from a process perspective; therefore the&#xD;
    Logical Process Model defines the complete business solution for Processes and Activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Logical Roles Model is created&amp;nbsp;very early during the architecture development, and fully detailed and adjusted&#xD;
    as the architecture progresses. This artifact is enclosed within the Logical Perspective artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (at the &lt;em>user&lt;/em> level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, starting now at this Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information /&#xD;
    services may be controlled based upon a user's Role: RBAC). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Logical Actors&#xD;
    and the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process&#xD;
    analysts and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by&#xD;
    systems analysts and software architects to provide context for software development and GUI designs.&lt;/span>&#xD;

    In UAM the primary purpose of modeling Roles and Actors is to describe how the activities are interacted with by&#xD;
    various internal and external users, and most importantly by its customers and partners. All interactions of Roles and&#xD;
    Actors (both internal and external) with activities are defined; therefore employees that interact with activities and&#xD;
    process are also modeled.&#xD;

    processes) that when structured into a model define the complete set of locations, and their interrelationships, at&#xD;
    which the system under study operates. At the logical level locations are abstracted, likely into types of locations.&#xD;
    For example a bank operates at many locations, but each one can be abstracted into Logical Locations such as Head&#xD;
    Office, Main Branch, Branch, Full Service ATM, and ATM among others.&#xD;

    The Technical Locations Viewpoint is used, within the enterprise architecture context, to either specify technical&#xD;

    (near-implementation) level view of enterprise locations. Both may be described, if desired and appropriate, as well.&#xD;

name=&quot;XE_Technical_Perspective__Technical_Locations_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The locations viewpoint&amp;nbsp;is a key element of the Technical Perspective. It may be used to show how entities (data),&#xD;
    processes and the network aspects (and the required supporting infrastructure) are organized and deployed throughout&#xD;
    the system (or enterprise). In other words, some entity model, process model and roles model aspects may be shown to&#xD;
    best advantage in the locations model. Partitioning and layering is used to separate these aspects in the locations&#xD;
    model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The locations model works best if layering is used to deal with complexity and to provide views appropriate for the&#xD;
    audience and objectives; and comprehension is greatly improved. Detail is hidden, while allowing for its definition in&#xD;
    lower layers, as required in meeting the objectives of the architecture effort.&#xD;

    The enterprise that owns the IT architectures needs to decide how they are to be classified and organized for easy&#xD;
    search and retrieval by&amp;nbsp;IT architects, designers and implementation people. Although the creation and storage of&#xD;
    models is currently outside the scope of UAM, it is suggestion that they be organized in a widely available searchable&#xD;

    management facility, but this may limit functionality depending upon the modeling tool used.&amp;nbsp;The&#xD;

    the complete business Activity, just the presentation layer or interface. These Technical Activities therefore&#xD;
    represent the boundary portion of the Technical Process Model—the Technical Process Model captures all Processes,&#xD;
    Activities and Tasks, but with the interface/GUI portion also being represented in the Technical Roles Model through a&#xD;
    User Task (or Service Task for system interactions). The Technical Roles Model is incomplete from a process&#xD;
    perspective; therefore the Technical Process Model defines the complete business solution for Processes and&#xD;
    Activities.&lt;br />&#xD;

    If the business analysis is well understood by all stakeholders and the project team, the benefits of developing a&#xD;
    Business Entity Model are significantly diminished, however, this is rarely the case. Where this occurs, the Business&#xD;
    Entity Model may be sparsely defined. However, it is usually wise to develop a complete model to improve understanding&#xD;
    of the way the business activities work with and use the business entities.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    One&amp;nbsp;can choose to develop an &quot;incomplete&quot; Business Entity Model, focusing on explaining &quot;things&quot; important only to&#xD;
    a particular business domain or activity in question. Such a model does not include the complete information content of&#xD;
    the &quot;system&quot;. This model is useful for providing a common basis with which concepts can be clarified and defined, while&#xD;
    limiting scope and effort. Core entities should be included along with business entities having direct relationships to&#xD;
    the core to provide context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is to do business re-engineering, one should consider building two&#xD;
    variants of the Business Entity Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisaged new target&#xD;
    situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current versions of the Business Entity Model is simply an inventory of existing data models, but brought up to a&#xD;
    (conceptual) high-level. The entities of the model are not described in any detail. Typically brief descriptions are&#xD;
    sufficient. The target version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be&#xD;
    reconsidered and aligned with the new business strategy and goals.&#xD;

    The Business Roles Model is a way of expressing the Business Activities&amp;nbsp;interacted with by&amp;nbsp;Actors. Actors are&#xD;
    conceptual at the highest level. The types of Actors and interactions they have with Business Activities are what are&#xD;
    modeled. Business Activities in this context equate to &quot;business interactions&quot;, which will be detailed more at the&#xD;
    Logical and Technical levels. Note that only Actors are defined at the Business level since defining Roles requires&#xD;
    that a &quot;automate&quot; vs. &quot;manual&quot; decision to be made, which is not done at the Business level; this is left to the&#xD;
    Logical level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (and the user level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, but only starting at the Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information&#xD;
    / services may be controlled based upon a user's Role). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Business Actors and&#xD;
    the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process analysts&#xD;
    and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by systems&#xD;
    analysts and software architects to provide context for software development.&lt;/span>&#xD;

    Business Entities represent an abstraction of important (typically persistent) information within the business. Any&#xD;

    Information that is not stored but is created or determined on-demand (when necessary) is also probably not a Business&#xD;

    A Business Actor can be equated to the external people or systems that interact with the system under study. Actors are&#xD;
    not necessarily external to the business; they may also represent internal “user” interactions with the system.&#xD;
    Business Actors are high-level conceptualizations of the Actors with the system; further analysis is required to fully&#xD;
    understand and define required actors. Note that actors are not individuals nor are they necessarily equivalent to job&#xD;
    titles; instead, they describe the behavior in the enterprise and the responsibilities of the associated “user”.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Entity Model defines a logical data model for the enterprise or system, as defined by the scope of the&#xD;
    modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define the entities involved, and the relationships between them needed to&#xD;
    support the defined logical processes. The definition must be valid for the defined scope, and must eliminate any&#xD;
    ambiguity regarding what they represent.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Relationships between entities are derived directly from analysis of the business, its activities and processes. Two&#xD;
    main aspects are important, the relationships supporting the business processes and functions, and the relationships&#xD;
    supporting the monitoring and management of the business. Note that generalizations, aggregations and other types of&#xD;
    analysis are added at this logical level. All attributes of the entities should be defined along with candidate keys&#xD;
    and identities for each if desired.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The logical actors and logical roles that work with these entities are also identified if desired. The structure of&#xD;
    defined actors and roles, along with their relationships to entities, is used to identify the access controls aspect of&#xD;
    IT security required. This part of the model is derived from and uses elements from other views, such as the Logical&#xD;
    Process Model and the Logical Roles Model, which illustrates how intertwined and dependent the viewpoints are within&#xD;
    UAM, or any architecture for that matter. See the Logical Process Model and Logical Roles Model definitions for more&#xD;
    detail regarding these derived relationships to Logical Roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The entities along with relationships, represent a logical model of the entities. This model should evolve quickly and&#xD;
    may remain fluid for some time as different representations and their implications are explored. Formal documentation&#xD;
    can impede this process, so be careful how much energy you expend on maintaining this 'model' in a formal&#xD;
    sense.&amp;nbsp;Don't spend a&amp;nbsp;lot of time polishing the model, which my be expendable, until it is stable. The&#xD;
    entities, if chosen carefully will survive into the&amp;nbsp;Technical level relatively unchanged. However, some of them&#xD;
    may represent whole collaborations of objects, often encapsulated by subsystems in the Technical model, and certainly&#xD;
    when a project is instantiated to implement&amp;nbsp;the system then a lot more analysis will be done and detail added,&#xD;
    which will likely result in much re-factoring of the model at the very least.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;em>As-Is&lt;/em> Model vs. &lt;em>To-Be&lt;/em> Model&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the modeling effort is to do business re-engineering, one should consider building two variants of&#xD;
    the Logical Entity Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisaged new target situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current versions of the Logical Entity Model is compared to the target version to identify changes. The target&#xD;
    version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be reconsidered and aligned&#xD;
    with the new business strategy and goals.&#xD;

    The Logical Process viewpoint defines the Activities and Processes involved in the system or enterprise, as defined by&#xD;
    the scope of the modeling effort. Depending upon the context and scope of the modeling effort, the level of detail at&#xD;
    this logical level may be quite extensive or be very broad and conceptual. It illustrates the sequence flow of the&#xD;
    Logical Activities, forming a process, along with events, gateways and actors.&amp;nbsp;It is a way of expressing the&#xD;
    business workflows through the definition of individual activities, events, gateways&amp;nbsp;and the flow between them.&#xD;
    Logical Entities added to this diagram help in understanding how they are involved in the processes,&amp;nbsp;but this&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Locations viewpoint describes the structure of locations (each of which contain activities, roles, and&#xD;
    processes) that when structured into a model define the complete set of locations, and their interrelationships, at&#xD;
    which the system under study operates. At the logical level locations are abstracted, likely into types of locations.&#xD;
    For example a bank operates at many locations, but each one can be abstracted into Logical Locations such as Head&#xD;
    Office, Main Branch, Branch, Full Service ATM, and ATM among others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Locations_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Locations_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objective is to clearly define the locations involved, and the sorts of services provided within and between them.&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding on the architecture for applications and services, so that they operate&#xD;
    effectively, over a slow speed WAN for example. Security implications are also eventually derived from this model for&#xD;
    example; at this level some of these defined &quot;locations&quot; may include security domains and zones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to clearly define the locations and the relationships between them in terms of the services&#xD;
    (activities/workflows) provided and facilities provided (data/voice, etc.).&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Roles viewpoint defines the roles, at the logical level, involved in and important to the defined business&#xD;
    processes. The roles implemented by the logical systems are incorporated into the model, optionally including&#xD;
    relationships to business functions (activities) involved with the role. Roles have a direct relationship to user&#xD;
    interactions with the system. That is, for every role users have within a system, there is a set of activities&#xD;
    (defining a business process) that include the user interfaces (show as User Tasks). Security is thus an important&#xD;
    aspect of this model as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus of the roles model is on all interactions with the business processes and activities, with the Logical Roles&#xD;
    representing the “interface protocol” (in the case of system interactions: Service Tasks) or “graphical user interface”&#xD;
    (GUI, in the case of human interactions: User Tasks) to the Logical Activities and Processes. At the Technical level&#xD;
    these definitions are not implementable but will clearly specify the required structure and content for these&#xD;
    interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the context of IT architecture and the Logical Roles Viewpoint, the Activities within this model do not represent&#xD;
    the complete business Activity, just the presentation layer or interface. These Logical Activities therefore represent&#xD;
    the boundary portion of the Logical Process Model—the Logical Process Model captures all Processes, Activities and&#xD;
    Tasks, but with the interface/GUI portion also being represented in the Logical Roles Model through a User Task (or&#xD;
    Service Task for system interactions). The Logical Roles Model is incomplete from a process perspective; therefore the&#xD;
    Logical Process Model defines the complete business solution for Processes and Activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Logical Roles Model is created&amp;nbsp;very early during the architecture development, and fully detailed and adjusted&#xD;
    as the architecture progresses. This artifact is enclosed within the Logical Perspective artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (at the &lt;em>user&lt;/em> level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, starting now at this Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information /&#xD;
    services may be controlled based upon a user's Role: RBAC). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Logical Actors&#xD;
    and the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process&#xD;
    analysts and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by&#xD;
    systems analysts and software architects to provide context for software development and GUI designs.&lt;/span>&#xD;

    A&amp;nbsp;Logical Role that is equated to or defined by the behavior (and by extension its responsibilities) that it&#xD;
    interacts with in the system—the activities that it interacts with. A role is in essence the “interface” to the&#xD;
    activities with which it interacts. A role can be assumed (aggregated) by any kind of actor, either human or a system&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Logical roles are identified early in the process of modeling a business. It is not a simple user-to-role analysis. The&#xD;
    same role can be played by multiple users (people), and a user may assume multiple roles during their interaction with&#xD;
    the systems of the business. Analysis of these interactions must be done in order to categorize them into the various&#xD;
    roles. The benefit is a simplification of the user interface required to be implemented to support the various users.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Actors are a categorization, based upon required interactions, of external interactions with the system.&amp;nbsp;At the&#xD;
    Logical level they represent the external entities that interact with the system, be they users or other systems.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to IT Architects, the following people are interested in actors:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Business analysts&lt;/b>, when defining the boundaries of the organization and required processes;&#xD;

        &lt;b>Business designers&lt;/b>, when describing business processes and their interaction with external entities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>User-interface designers&lt;/b>, as input to capturing characteristics on human [system] actors;&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Logical Actor can be equated to the external people or systems that interact with the system under study. Actors are&#xD;
    not necessarily external to the business; they may also represent internal “user” interactions with the system. Logical&#xD;
    Actors are high-level conceptualizations of the Actors with the system; further analysis is required to fully&#xD;
    understand and define required actors. Note that actors are not individuals nor are they necessarily equivalent to job&#xD;
    titles; instead, they describe the behavior in the enterprise and the responsibilities of the associated “user”.&#xD;

    A Logical Location defines the locations where the enterprise has a presence that it implements and manages. Logical&#xD;

    locations, based upon the technical (business) functions supported, with having processes and services that are under&#xD;
    the authority of the enterprise (or system) in question. This element provides the ability to manage complexity in&#xD;
    architectures through the definition of hierarchical models. Analysis of locations must be done in order to categorize&#xD;

    best advantage in the locations model. Partitioning and layering is used to separate these aspects in the locations&#xD;
    model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The locations model works best if layering is used to deal with complexity and to provide views appropriate for the&#xD;
    audience and objectives; and comprehension is greatly improved. Detail is hidden, while allowing for its definition in&#xD;
    lower layers, as required in meeting the objectives of the architecture effort.&#xD;

    In UAM the primary purpose of modeling Roles and Actors is to describe how the activities are interacted with by&#xD;
    various internal and external users, and most importantly by its customers and partners. All interactions of Roles and&#xD;
    Actors (both internal and external) with activities are defined; therefore employees that interact with activities and&#xD;
    process are also modeled.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus of the roles model is on all interactions with the business processes and activities, with the Technical&#xD;
    Roles representing the “interface protocol” (in the case of system interactions: Service Tasks) or “graphical user&#xD;
    interface” (GUI, in the case of human interactions: User Tasks) to the Technical Activities and Processes. At the&#xD;
    Technical level these definitions are not implementable but will clearly specify the required structure and content for&#xD;
    these interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the context of IT architecture and the Technical Roles Viewpoint, the Activities within this model do not represent&#xD;
    the complete business Activity, just the presentation layer or interface. These Technical Activities therefore&#xD;
    represent the boundary portion of the Technical Process Model—the Technical Process Model captures all Processes,&#xD;
    Activities and Tasks, but with the interface/GUI portion also being represented in the Technical Roles Model through a&#xD;
    User Task (or Service Task for system interactions). The Technical Roles Model is incomplete from a process&#xD;
    perspective; therefore the Technical Process Model defines the complete business solution for Processes and&#xD;
    Activities.&lt;br />&#xD;

    A Technical Entity is a representation of the information and data used within the system being modeled. At the&#xD;
    technical level a very complete view of the data entities are defined, including their attributes and relationships. If&#xD;
    desired, primary keys and other structural information may also be included. Technical Entities are used to define a&#xD;
    physical data model in support of the processes and activities of the system, but perhaps not to the level of detail&#xD;
    required for implementation (depending upon the context and objectives of the architecture effort). This element&#xD;
    provides the ability to manage complexity in architectures through the definition of hierarchical models.&#xD;

    A Technical Actor can be equated to the external people or systems that interact with the system under study. Actors&#xD;
    are not necessarily external to the business; they may also represent internal “user” interactions with the system.&#xD;
    Technical Actors are conceptualizations of the Actors with the system; further analysis is required to fully understand&#xD;
    and define required actors. Note that actors are not individuals nor are they necessarily equivalent to job titles;&#xD;
    instead, they describe the behavior in the enterprise and the responsibilities of the associated “user”.&#xD;

    If the business analysis is well understood by all stakeholders and the project team, the benefits of developing a&#xD;

    One&amp;nbsp;can choose to develop an &quot;incomplete&quot; Business Entity Model, focusing on explaining &quot;things&quot; important only to&#xD;
    a particular business domain or activity in question. Such a model does not include the complete information content of&#xD;
    the &quot;system&quot;. This model is useful for providing a common basis with which concepts can be clarified and defined, while&#xD;
    limiting scope and effort. Core entities should be included along with business entities having direct relationships to&#xD;
    the core to provide context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is to do business re-engineering, one should consider building two&#xD;
    variants of the Business Entity Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisaged new target&#xD;
    situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current versions of the Business Entity Model is simply an inventory of existing data models, but brought up to a&#xD;
    (conceptual) high-level. The entities of the model are not described in any detail. Typically brief descriptions are&#xD;
    sufficient. The target version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be&#xD;
    reconsidered and aligned with the new business strategy and goals.&#xD;

    be aggregate multiple roles, and an actor can be associated with multiple physical people (or systems). Roles also&#xD;
    include security concepts and constructs. An employee of the enterprise is typically multiple actors with the system&#xD;

    A Business Security Zone is represented as a simple cloud shaped background geometric shape (of an appropriate color if&#xD;
    desired to illustrate the fundamental nature of the Zone) with the name applied to one corner or outside the perimeter&#xD;
    (e.g. “HR Services”).&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>A Business Security Zone is an environment or context that is defined by security policies, security models, and security&#xD;
architecture, including a set of resources and set of system entities that are authorized to access the resources. A&#xD;
Business Zone may contain one or more sub-zones. Different sub-zones are created when security models or policies (and&#xD;
possibly architecture) are significantly different from one zone to the other, or are conflicting. Separate Business Zones&#xD;
provide clearer separation of concerns and ease policy enforcement and system management. Synonyms: &lt;em>security zone&lt;/em>&#xD;

    The Technical Entity viewpoint is not an information or data design model, but it should be fairly close. The focus is&#xD;

    The Technical Locations Viewpoint is used, within the enterprise architecture context, to either specify technical&#xD;

    The locations viewpoint&amp;nbsp;is a key element of the Technical Perspective. It may be used to show how entities (data),&#xD;
    processes and the network aspects (and the required supporting infrastructure) are organized and deployed throughout&#xD;
    the system (or enterprise). In other words, some entity model, process model and roles model aspects may be shown to&#xD;
    best advantage in the locations model. Partitioning and layering is used to separate these aspects in the locations&#xD;
    model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The locations model works best if layering is used to deal with complexity and to provide views appropriate for the&#xD;

    In UAM the primary purpose of modeling Roles and Actors is to describe how the activities are interacted with by&#xD;
    various internal and external users, and most importantly by its customers and partners. All interactions of Roles and&#xD;
    Actors (both internal and external) with activities are defined; therefore employees that interact with activities and&#xD;

    The focus of the roles model is on all interactions with the business processes and activities, with the Technical&#xD;
    Roles representing the “interface protocol” (in the case of system interactions: Service Tasks) or “graphical user&#xD;
    interface” (GUI, in the case of human interactions: User Tasks) to the Technical Activities and Processes. At the&#xD;
    Technical level these definitions are not implementable but will clearly specify the required structure and content for&#xD;
    these interfaces.&#xD;

    In the context of IT architecture and the Technical Roles Viewpoint, the Activities within this model do not represent&#xD;
    the complete business Activity, just the presentation layer or interface. These Technical Activities therefore&#xD;
    represent the boundary portion of the Technical Process Model—the Technical Process Model captures all Processes,&#xD;
    Activities and Tasks, but with the interface/GUI portion also being represented in the Technical Roles Model through a&#xD;

    A Technical Entity is a representation of the information and data used within the system being modeled. At the&#xD;
    technical level a very complete view of the data entities are defined, including their attributes and relationships. If&#xD;
    desired, primary keys and other structural information may also be included. Technical Entities are used to define a&#xD;
    physical data model in support of the processes and activities of the system, but perhaps not to the level of detail&#xD;

    The Logical Entity Model defines a logical data model for the enterprise or system, as defined by the scope of the&#xD;
    modeling effort. The objective is to clearly define the entities involved, and the relationships between them needed to&#xD;
    support the defined logical processes. The definition must be valid for the defined scope, and must eliminate any&#xD;
    ambiguity regarding what they represent.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Entity_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Relationships between entities are derived directly from analysis of the business, its activities and processes. Two&#xD;
    main aspects are important, the relationships supporting the business processes and functions, and the relationships&#xD;
    supporting the monitoring and management of the business. Note that generalizations, aggregations and other types of&#xD;
    analysis are added at this logical level. All attributes of the entities should be defined along with candidate keys&#xD;
    and identities for each if desired.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The logical actors and logical roles that work with these entities are also identified if desired. The structure of&#xD;
    defined actors and roles, along with their relationships to entities, is used to identify the access controls aspect of&#xD;
    IT security required. This part of the model is derived from and uses elements from other views, such as the Logical&#xD;
    Process Model and the Logical Roles Model, which illustrates how intertwined and dependent the viewpoints are within&#xD;
    UAM, or any architecture for that matter. See the Logical Process Model and Logical Roles Model definitions for more&#xD;
    detail regarding these derived relationships to Logical Roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The entities along with relationships, represent a logical model of the entities. This model should evolve quickly and&#xD;
    may remain fluid for some time as different representations and their implications are explored. Formal documentation&#xD;
    can impede this process, so be careful how much energy you expend on maintaining this 'model' in a formal&#xD;
    sense.&amp;nbsp;Don't spend a&amp;nbsp;lot of time polishing the model, which my be expendable, until it is stable. The&#xD;
    entities, if chosen carefully will survive into the&amp;nbsp;Technical level relatively unchanged. However, some of them&#xD;
    may represent whole collaborations of objects, often encapsulated by subsystems in the Technical model, and certainly&#xD;
    when a project is instantiated to implement&amp;nbsp;the system then a lot more analysis will be done and detail added,&#xD;
    which will likely result in much re-factoring of the model at the very least.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;em>As-Is&lt;/em> Model vs. &lt;em>To-Be&lt;/em> Model&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the modeling effort is to do business re-engineering, one should consider building two variants of&#xD;
    the Logical Entity Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisaged new target situation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current versions of the Logical Entity Model is compared to the target version to identify changes. The target&#xD;
    version of the model requires most of the work. The current data and relationships need to be reconsidered and aligned&#xD;
    with the new business strategy and goals.&#xD;

    relationships to business functions (activities) involved with the role. Roles have a direct relationship to user&#xD;
    interactions with the system. That is, for every role users have within a system, there is a set of activities&#xD;

    Service Task for system interactions). The Logical Roles Model is incomplete from a process perspective; therefore the&#xD;
    Logical Process Model defines the complete business solution for Processes and Activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Logical Roles Model is created&amp;nbsp;very early during the architecture development, and fully detailed and adjusted&#xD;
    as the architecture progresses. This artifact is enclosed within the Logical Perspective artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (at the &lt;em>user&lt;/em> level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, starting now at this Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information /&#xD;
    services may be controlled based upon a user's Role: RBAC). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Logical Actors&#xD;
    and the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process&#xD;
    analysts and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by&#xD;
    systems analysts and software architects to provide context for software development and GUI designs.&lt;/span>&#xD;

    A&amp;nbsp;Logical Role that is equated to or defined by the behavior (and by extension its responsibilities) that it&#xD;
    interacts with in the system—the activities that it interacts with. A role is in essence the “interface” to the&#xD;
    activities with which it interacts. A role can be assumed (aggregated) by any kind of actor, either human or a system&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Logical roles are identified early in the process of modeling a business. It is not a simple user-to-role analysis. The&#xD;
    same role can be played by multiple users (people), and a user may assume multiple roles during their interaction with&#xD;
    the systems of the business. Analysis of these interactions must be done in order to categorize them into the various&#xD;
    roles. The benefit is a simplification of the user interface required to be implemented to support the various users.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Actors are a categorization, based upon required interactions, of external interactions with the system.&amp;nbsp;At the&#xD;
    Logical level they represent the external entities that interact with the system, be they users or other systems.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to IT Architects, the following people are interested in actors:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Business analysts&lt;/b>, when defining the boundaries of the organization and required processes;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Business designers&lt;/b>, when describing business processes and their interaction with external entities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>User-interface designers&lt;/b>, as input to capturing characteristics on human [system] actors;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>System analysts&lt;/b>, as input to finding [system] actors;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Logical Actor can be equated to the external people or systems that interact with the system under study. Actors are&#xD;
    not necessarily external to the business; they may also represent internal “user” interactions with the system. Logical&#xD;
    Actors are high-level conceptualizations of the Actors with the system; further analysis is required to fully&#xD;
    understand and define required actors. Note that actors are not individuals nor are they necessarily equivalent to job&#xD;
    titles; instead, they describe the behavior in the enterprise and the responsibilities of the associated “user”.&#xD;

    A Logical Location defines the locations where the enterprise has a presence that it implements and manages. Logical&#xD;
    level activities, devices, and processes are defined that are found at the locations. Locations are a categorization of&#xD;
    locations, based upon the technical (business) functions supported, with having processes and services that are under&#xD;
    the authority of the enterprise (or system) in question. This element provides the ability to manage complexity in&#xD;
    architectures through the definition of hierarchical models. Analysis of locations must be done in order to categorize&#xD;
    them and ultimately define generalizations, for example, &quot;Self-service kiosk&quot;.&#xD;
