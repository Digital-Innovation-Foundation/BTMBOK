    Recognizing the national and economic security of the United States depends on the reliable function of critical&#xD;
    infrastructure, the President issued Executive Order (EO) 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in&#xD;
    February 2013. The Order directed NIST to work with stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework – based on existing&#xD;
    standards, guidelines, and practices - for reducing cyber risks to critical infrastructure. The Cybersecurity&#xD;
    Enhancement Act of 2014 reinforced NIST’s EO 13636 role.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Created through collaboration between industry and government, the voluntary Framework consists of standards,&#xD;
    guidelines, and practices to promote the protection of critical infrastructure. The prioritized, flexible, repeatable,&#xD;
    and cost-effective approach of the Framework helps owners and operators of critical infrastructure to manage&#xD;
    cybersecurity-related risk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Framework Core and Informative References are available as separate downloads in three formats: spreadsheet (Excel)&#xD;
    , alternate view (PDF) , and database (FileMaker Pro).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A companion Roadmap discusses future steps and&#xD;
    identifies key areas of cybersecurity development, alignment, and collaboration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Department of Homeland Security's Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community C³ Voluntary Program helps critical&#xD;
    infrastructure owners and operators align with existing resources to assist them in using the Cybersecurity Framework&#xD;
    and managing their cyber risks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NIST continues to welcome informal feedback about the Framework and Roadmap. Organizations and individuals may&#xD;
    contribute observations, suggestions, examples of use, and lessons learned to &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;mailto:cyberframework@nist.gov&quot;>&lt;u>&lt;font color=&quot;#0066cc&quot;>cyberframework@nist.gov&lt;/font>&lt;/u>&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    WHAT IS THE FRAMEWORK?&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Framework is voluntary guidance, based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices for organizations to better&#xD;
    manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. In addition to helping organizations manage and reduce risks, it was designed to&#xD;
    foster risk and cybersecurity management communications amongst both internal and external organizational stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    AN INTRODUCTION TO THE COMPONENTS OF THE FRAMEWORK&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Cybersecurity Framework consists of three main components: the Core, Implementation Tiers, and Profiles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Framework Core provides a set of desired cybersecurity activities and outcomes using common language that is easy&#xD;
    to understand.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Core guides organizations in managing and reducing their cybersecurity risks in a way&#xD;
    that complements an organization’s existing cybersecurity and risk management processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Cyberframework New to Framework Pie&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Framework Implementation Tiers assist organizations by providing context on how an organization views cybersecurity&#xD;
    risk management. The Tiers guide organizations to consider the appropriate level of rigor for their cybersecurity&#xD;
    program and are often used as a communication tool to discuss risk appetite, mission priority, and budget.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Framework Profiles are an organization’s unique alignment of their organizational requirements and objectives, risk&#xD;
    appetite, and resources against the desired outcomes of the Framework Core.&amp;nbsp; Profiles are primarily used to&#xD;
    identify and prioritize opportunities for improving cybersecurity at an organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
