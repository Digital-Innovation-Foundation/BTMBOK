  <mainDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_MDD__References&quot; name=&quot;XE_MDD__References&quot;>&lt;/a>Several of the challenges that software organizations face today&#xD;
include an increase in the complexity of their information technology (IT) infrastructures and solutions, applications that&#xD;
may be difficult to use, and continued pressure to achieve tight time-to-market timelines. Organizations use many&#xD;
approaches to address these problems, including models. Models can embody critical solutions and insights and thus can be&#xD;
seen as assets for an organization. For example, a pattern that describes a recurring problem, its recurring solution, and&#xD;
the context in which it is relevant can be expressed as a model and shared with others. This paper presents some of the&#xD;
steps to identify reusable models, organize them for reuse, and package, publish, and ultimately reuse themâ€”all with a&#xD;
focus on the benefit to the business and the alignment of IT to the needs of the business. Whereas the concepts associated&#xD;
with reuse are not new, organizing models for reuse in the manner described herein represents more recent techniques.</mainDescription>
