    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What do managers do to help organizations achieve top performance?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the roles that managers play in organizations?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the characteristics that effective managers display?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Most management textbooks would say, as does this one, that managers spend their time engaged in planning, organizing,&#xD;
    staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, and controlling. These activities, as Hannaway found in her study of&#xD;
    managers at work, “do not, in fact, describe what managers do.”1 At best they seem to describe vague objectives that&#xD;
    managers are continually trying to accomplish. The real world, however, is far from being that simple. The world in&#xD;
    which most managers work is a “messy and hectic stream of ongoing activity.”2&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    You&lt;br />&#xD;
    So, you’re in this course and you may have pondered, or discussed with others, what this course will be about. You&#xD;
    probably have some preconceptions of what management is all about. You must manage your time, deciding on how much&#xD;
    study time you will devote to your management and accounting classes, for instance. You may have had a summer or&#xD;
    part-time job where you had a manager whom you had to report to. You may have followed news reports on successful&#xD;
    managers like Jeff Bezos of Amazon or Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and want to learn what made them successful so you&#xD;
    can emulate their practices in your business career. You may have the impression (not an accurate one) that management&#xD;
    is basically just common sense and that you really don’t need to take this course except that you must meet your degree&#xD;
    requirement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You may be an accounting or marketing major who is taking this class because it is required for completion of your&#xD;
    degree requirements, but you don’t think that you will ever require what you learn in this class during your career&#xD;
    since you don’t plan on applying for HR jobs upon graduation. If you’re believing this, you could not be more mistaken.&#xD;
    Regardless of where you are in your career, be it as an individual contributor, project leader, or middle or senior&#xD;
    manager, what you will get out of this course will be valuable. If your first job out of college is as an accountant,&#xD;
    sales representative, or another entry-level position, you will appreciate the roles that your managers, both direct&#xD;
    and senior level, play in an organization and the behaviors and actions that will get you recognized and appreciated.&#xD;
    Best of luck!&#xD;
