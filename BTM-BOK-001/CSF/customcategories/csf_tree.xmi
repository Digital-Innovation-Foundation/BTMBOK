  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Recognizing the national and economic security of the United States depends on the reliable function of critical&#xD;
    infrastructure, the President issued Executive Order (EO) 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in&#xD;
    February 2013. The Order directed NIST to work with stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework – based on existing&#xD;
    standards, guidelines, and practices - for reducing cyber risks to critical infrastructure. The Cybersecurity&#xD;
    Enhancement Act of 2014 reinforced NIST’s EO 13636 role.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Created through collaboration between industry and government, the voluntary Framework consists of standards,&#xD;
    guidelines, and practices to promote the protection of critical infrastructure. The prioritized, flexible, repeatable,&#xD;
    and cost-effective approach of the Framework helps owners and operators of critical infrastructure to manage&#xD;
    cybersecurity-related risk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Framework Core and Informative References are available as separate downloads in three formats: spreadsheet (Excel)&#xD;
    , alternate view (PDF) , and database (FileMaker Pro).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A companion Roadmap discusses future steps and&#xD;
    identifies key areas of cybersecurity development, alignment, and collaboration.&#xD;
