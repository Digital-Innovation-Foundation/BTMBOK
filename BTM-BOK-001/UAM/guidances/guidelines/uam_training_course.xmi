    IT architecture models and other deliverables are an excellent source for training materials. These include but are not&#xD;
    limited to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Introduction overview of the &quot;system&quot;, including the enterprise and its process in the case of an EA;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operator manuals or other process-centric training;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data models and their structure and usage;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Network overview, or details based upon the Locations Models;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User structure and interactions based upon Roles models, including IT security aspects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are just a few of the examples of training courses (or even simple briefings) that may be developed based upon&#xD;
    the various aspects of the IT architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The context and objectives of the IT architecture will be a fundamental driver for the level of detail included, along&#xD;
    with the target audience. Therefore, agreeing the target audience is key prior to staring into the course development.&#xD;
    Once this is agreed, the level of skill of this audience is defined, which dictates the types of skills to be taught&#xD;
    during the course (comparing these to those required by the system).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Defining the objectives of the course is also important ... what should the target audience learn during the&#xD;
    course?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
