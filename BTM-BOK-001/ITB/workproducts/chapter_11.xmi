    Marketing plays a key role in the success of businesses. It is the task of marketing to generate sales for the firm.&#xD;
    Sales revenue, in turn, pays workers’ salaries, buys supplies, covers the costs of new buildings and equipment, and&#xD;
    hopefully enables the company to earn a profit. This chapter looks at the nature of marketing and the creation of&#xD;
    product and pricing strategies to meet customers’ needs. In this chapter, you will learn about the marketing concept,&#xD;
    marketing strategies, and consumer and business buying decisions. You will also see how the marketing mix is used to&#xD;
    create sales opportunities. We discuss how new products are created and how they go through periods of sales growth and&#xD;
    then decline. Next you will discover how managers set prices to reach organizational goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Rachel Kuhr: Mark Cuban’s Shark Tank Empire&lt;br />&#xD;
    Rachel Kuhr is the product innovation and development specialist for Mark Cuban’s investments in the ABC show Shark&#xD;
    Tank. Two years ago, after watching an episode, Kuhr e-mailed Mark Cuban and attached a resume that highlighted her&#xD;
    mechanical engineering and product development expertise. Her approach appealed to Cuban, and she was contacted the&#xD;
    next day by Abe Minkara, head of Cuban’s business development team. After a Skype interview in which Minkara was&#xD;
    impressed with Kuhr’s skill set of both creativity and attention to process, she was hired to fill that role and work&#xD;
    with several start-ups that Cuban acquired an investment in through the show.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Kuhr now coaches and collaborates with over 60 companies that reside in Cuban’s business portfolio. Rather than start&#xD;
    out with detailed plans and building sophisticated prototypes, Kuhr favors using things like a whiteboard, Post-it&#xD;
    notes, colored pens, and highlighters to sketch out the ideas. Such an approach uses the best practices from&#xD;
    brainstorming that allow fatal flaws to steer the direction of product development before spending lots of resources,&#xD;
    both human and financial, on a single idea for too long. This approach also allows the product development team to&#xD;
    incorporate the user experience, which is sometimes overlooked when the focus is squarely on the product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the companies that Kuhr works with created Chapul Cricket Bars. Chapul Cricket Bars was the first company to use&#xD;
    insect-based “flour” in the manufacture of high- energy protein bars. After the deal on Shark Tank, company founder Pat&#xD;
    Crowley and Kuhr decided to take the flying insect logo off the product design and renamed the bars with names such as&#xD;
    Aztec, Matcha, and Chaco instead of the “Cricket Bar” name.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another Cuban investment was the Austin, Texas–based BeatBox Beverages. To better understand how typical consumers&#xD;
    would relate to boxed flavored cocktails, Kuhr attended several fraternity parties at Southern Methodist University and&#xD;
    off-campus bars. She asked questions that addressed how a variety of consumers decide on what to drink on different&#xD;
    occasions and in different settings. Since securing a $1 million dollar investment from Cuban, and working with Rachel&#xD;
    Kuhr, online and distribution sales through stores has skyrocketed according to Justin Fenchel, BeatBox Beverages’ CEO.&#xD;
