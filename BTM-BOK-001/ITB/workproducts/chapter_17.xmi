    Your Career in Business&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    How can you enhance your interpersonal skills?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why is learning to plan so important in school and in the real world?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What skills should you develop in school that can transfer easily to your professional life and make it a&#xD;
    success?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are some strategies that will help you find, keep, and advance in your dream job?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What key attributes do employers look for when interviewing job candidates?&lt;br />&#xD;
    You Are a Winner Because You Elected to Go to College!&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Never Quit Until You Have Your Degree in Hand!&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What makes someone a winner in life? A winner is someone who goes through the various stages of life satisfied in&#xD;
    knowing that they have done their best: their best at work, home, and in all pursuits of life. A big part of having a&#xD;
    happy life is pursuing a career that offers job satisfaction and financial rewards. If you are going to “be all that&#xD;
    you can be,” you need a good education.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A college degree unlocks doors to economic opportunity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Why get a degree?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Get and keep a better job. Because the world is changing rapidly and many jobs rely on new technology, more jobs&#xD;
    require education beyond high school. With a college education, you will have more jobs from which to choose.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Earn more money. People who go to college usually earn more than those who do not. Currently, a bachelor’s degree is&#xD;
    worth a minimum of $20,000 a year more than a high school diploma. If your career spans 45 years, you could earn close&#xD;
    to $1 million more than a high school graduate.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Get a good start in life. A business college education helps you acquire a wide range of knowledge in many subjects as&#xD;
    well as an advanced understanding of your specialized area of business. College also trains you to express your&#xD;
    thoughts clearly in speech and in writing and to make informed decisions.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Simply stated, a degree in business gives you the chance to achieve the quality of life you deserve. The lifestyle, the&#xD;
    new friends, the purchasing power of a degree won’t guarantee happiness but will put you well on the road to finding&#xD;
    it.&#xD;
