    With this level of knowledge and expertise, and a corresponding amount of industry experience, a BPM Practitioner&#xD;
    holding the OCEB 2 Business Intermediate Level Certification should be qualified to design and execute, as part of a&#xD;
    team and possibly as a team leader, a BPM project of moderate scope including distributed components.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Extended coverage of the BMM lets the candidate relate their BPM projects to business need, while near-complete&#xD;
    coverage of BPMN 2 enables modeling to cover the many aspects of processes encountered in business today including&#xD;
    compensation, complex gateways and events, conversation and choreography diagrams, error handling, and more. (The OCEB&#xD;
    2 Technical Intermediate exam will complete coverage of BPMN 2).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    By adding coverage of Decision Management and Modeling to Business Rules, this level covers decision-making well beyond&#xD;
    BPMN decision gateways, while the benefits of a shared business vocabulary, introduced through SBVR, adds another&#xD;
    important point of view. (Similarly, the OCEB 2 Technical Intermediate exam will round out coverage of DMM.) Finally,&#xD;
    this level covers Frameworks for Process Quality and Governance concentrating on SOX, COBIT, ITIL, Six Sigma, and LEAN.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The OCEB 2 Business Intermediate Certification requires the OCEB 2 Fundamental Certification as prerequisite, and is&#xD;
    prerequisite for the OCEB 2 Business Advanced Certification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The OCEB 2 Business Intermediate Certification expires five years from the date the OCEB 2 Business Intermediate exam&#xD;
    is passed.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
