    Partner, Collaborator, and Industry Quotations&lt;br />&#xD;
    &quot;The NIST NCCoE is a great working example of the public-private partnership in action.&amp;nbsp; This partnership provides&#xD;
    value in both directions.&amp;nbsp; One recent example is our use of the draft SP 1800-18 and the PAM practice guides. The&#xD;
    guides contributed to our awareness of other institutions practices and were helpful in maturing our approach in this&#xD;
    space.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; — Jay Wiley, Deputy CISO, M&amp;amp;T Bank&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;Collaboration with the NCCoE and the extended NCEP partner community has been an excellent opportunity for Motorola&#xD;
    Solutions to advance standards-based cybersecurity technologies for the first responder community. It has allowed us to&#xD;
    work with some of the brightest minds in both the public and private sectors to solve unique and challenging&#xD;
    cybersecurity problems in a way that can be used by our customers. Together we work to share our collective knowledge&#xD;
    and experience to elevate the state of cybersecurity across diverse markets and for the betterment of all.&quot;&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; — Adam Lewis, Chief Security Architect, Motorola Solutions&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    “The NCCOE plays an important role in collaborating with the private sector on cybersecurity risk mitigation&#xD;
    strategies. The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) and our 6,800 member financial&#xD;
    institutions appreciate the opportunity to work with the NCCOE on mitigating risks from destructive malware attacks and&#xD;
    addressing risks associated with point of sale technologies used by merchants.”&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; — John Carlson, Chief of Staff of the FS-ISAC&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    “We value our public/private partnership with the NCCoE greatly and look forward to fulfilling our responsibilities and&#xD;
    commitments with great passion at the center.”&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; — Kevin Fiftal, Civilian Director, Intel Americas&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    “Mobile devices are fast becoming the primary way we communicate and remain productive, but their growth has also made&#xD;
    them a rich target for attack. Security threats to mobility come in many forms and protecting today’s mobile ecosystems&#xD;
    while respecting individual privacy is a balance we must achieve given the personal nature of these devices. We believe&#xD;
    public and private sector cooperation can guide the industry toward better mobile security solutions that achieve this&#xD;
    balance. The NIST NCCoE has championed strong security and privacy principles, setting aside any pride of ownership to&#xD;
    arrive at practical, interoperable cybersecurity solutions that can be implemented today. In working with them on the&#xD;
    1800 series documents and architecture, Lookout has continually been impressed by their collaborative nature,&#xD;
    expertise, and dedication to raising the bar for secure mobility standards.”&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; —Tim LeMaster, Director, Systems Engineering, Lookout&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) is a powerful example of what can be accomplished through&#xD;
    government-industry partnership. Splunk is excited to be working with NCCoE to drive improvements in cybersecurity in&#xD;
    key sectors of the economy. Public and private sector don’t always share the same mission, but when it comes to&#xD;
    cybersecurity, both face the same challenge of protecting their organizations from emerging threats. Modern&#xD;
    cybersecurity is an issue of national importance that needs to be addressed collectively.”&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; — Haiyan Song, Senior Vice President for Security Markets, Splunk&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;Our work with the Situational Awareness Use Case team at NCCoE has been a very important step in its collaborative&#xD;
    mission to improve the cybersecurity posture of our nation’s very critical Energy market. James McCarthy and the rest&#xD;
    of the team have clearly demonstrated their expertise and knowledge of the challenges and opportunities across the IT&#xD;
    and OT domains. TDi Technologies is honored to be a part of the Situational Awareness Use Case team and we look forward&#xD;
    to working with the NCCoE on future projects.”&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; — Bill Johnson, Founder and CEO, TDi Technologies&#xD;
