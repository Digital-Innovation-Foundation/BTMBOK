    Overview&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    UAM defines a number of &quot;gates&quot;—milestones where reviews of deliverables are done by various management fora. These are&#xD;
    not UAM deliverables, they are external to the development of IT architectures, but are generally inputs to UAM. These&#xD;
    fora are therefore&amp;nbsp;excellent opportunities for IT architects to participate and provide guidance and advice, and&#xD;
    to also get feedback. Most of these deliverables and fora are business management-related documents and business&#xD;
    planning.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each gate is defined below, followed by a presentation of the gates in the context of UAM inputs and outputs. Note that&#xD;
    within your organization the names of these fora and documents may be quite different—adapt the gates as required&#xD;
    (i.e., combine, eliminate,&amp;nbsp;and change as needed).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are three scenarios where IT-related governance has been defined. They are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Enterprise Planning&lt;/strong> - all IT-related enterprise planning, from the development of business needs&#xD;
        through to the pre-project definition of a business case. This includes gates 0-2.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>IT Projects&lt;/strong> - once a project charter is defined and the projects starts there are a number of&#xD;
        points in the development process where IT architects need to be involved. This scenario includes gates 3-6.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>IT Evolution&lt;/strong> - the evolution of the IT within the enterprise needs to be managed, through a change&#xD;
        management process. This scenario includes gate 7.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/roadmaps/uam_governance_60575AE0.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_p0Js0OCrEdynr9jlfK-aMA&quot;>Roadmap: Governance&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Gate 0&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Business Need has been defined. It is now reviewed, updated as required,&amp;nbsp;and approved. A Business Need describe&#xD;
    a required change to the business; to business processes, services, or other aspects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT architect can provide valuable input during the review of the need for the business change.&amp;nbsp;Their intimate&#xD;
    understanding of the technology and&amp;nbsp;it architecture enable them to provide valuable advice regarding the issue,&#xD;
    but also valuable input on possible solutions or opportunities. Many opportunities are available for IT technologies to&#xD;
    not only support the business, but provide enhancements—to productivity and in many other areas. IT architects are in a&#xD;
    position to provide valuable input when clarifying Business Needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Gate 1&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Business Opportunity has been defined. It is now reviewed, updated as required,&amp;nbsp;and approved. The Business&#xD;
    Opportunity is where the first notions of&amp;nbsp;possible solutions to the Business Opportunity are documented.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Part of the solution may&amp;nbsp;require changes to&amp;nbsp;business processes or other aspects. But more Opportunities also&#xD;
    require a technology component. This is where the IT architect provides advice on the possible solutions, and in the&#xD;
    context of the current IT environment within the enterprise. Pros and cons are identified for each solution, and one is&#xD;
    recommended. The architect may also identify opportunities for the application of new technologies, enhancing the&#xD;
    business possibilities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Gate 2&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Business Case has been defined. It is now reviewed, updated as required,&amp;nbsp;and approved. A Business Case outline&#xD;
    and describes a project to implement the Business Need/Opportunity. A BUsiness Case may also identify the need to&#xD;
    update or change existing processes or systems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The resources required in terms or time, people, and dollars, are included in a&amp;nbsp;Business Case. Therefore, a&#xD;
    solutions has been identified and agreed (from the BUsiness Opportunity) and these resource implications analyzed and&#xD;
    itemized. IT architects are the obvious source for this type of analysis&amp;nbsp;and solution documentation. Most Business&#xD;
    Cases these days will involve IT implementations, and therefore an understanding of the solution architecture and&#xD;
    implications on existing systems is needed to provide comprehensive advice. Business Cases need IT architect input at&#xD;
    the very least, and perhaps they should author them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Gate 3&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Project Charter or project requirement has been defined. It is now reviewed, updated as required,&amp;nbsp;and approved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;Project&amp;nbsp;Charter&amp;nbsp;i&lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;>s a statement of the scope, objectives, and participants&amp;nbsp;of&#xD;
    a project. It is a critical document to ensure that everyone involved in a project is aware of its&#xD;
    purpose,&amp;nbsp;objectives, and their role. It also includes specific on resources, both people and dollars. Therefore an&#xD;
    IT architect that understands the proposed solution and how it fit into the enterprise provides crucial input for this&#xD;
    review. The IT architect would also be able to clearly identify the stakeholders and other participants that need to be&#xD;
    involved.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Gate 4&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT architecture for a project has been defined, or is under development. This review ensures that the proposed&#xD;
    design fits in with current systems and enterprise standards.&amp;nbsp;The detailed design&amp;nbsp;is reviewed, updated as&#xD;
    required,&amp;nbsp;and approved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is typically more of an on-going involvement by IT architects during the system&amp;nbsp;detailed design.&amp;nbsp;IT&#xD;
    architects provide guidance and advice on the current IT architecture, and how the new/revised system fits into this&#xD;
    wider context. Also, the detailed design choices are reviewed to ensure that they are compatible with enterprise&#xD;
    standards (both technology and usage patterns) and that the solution is complete&amp;nbsp;(i.e.,&amp;nbsp;all function and&#xD;
    non-functions requirements are addressed).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Gate 5&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The system is being implemented. This review ensures that the resulting system fits in with current systems and&#xD;
    standards. The implementation (design documentation) is reviewed, updated as required,&amp;nbsp;and approved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is typically more of an on-going involvement by IT architects during the system implementation. A final review is&#xD;
    too late to change or influence the implementation! Detailed design choices are reviewed to ensure that they are&#xD;
    compatible with enterprise standards (both technology and usage patterns) and that the solution is&#xD;
    complete&amp;nbsp;(i.e.,&amp;nbsp;all function and non-functions requirements are addressed).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Gate 6&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The system has been designed and built. Now the system is transitioned to operations, which requires the review of all&#xD;
    documentation on the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This review ensures that the documentation, including the IT architecture, accurately captures the &lt;em>as-built&lt;/em>&#xD;
    result. This review may require updates to the IT architecture or to ADs. IT architects ensure that the resulting&#xD;
    system does indeed implement&amp;nbsp;the approved architecture, and that it is compatible with current and future&#xD;
    enterprise architectures and standards.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Gate 7&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A change is needed to a system in operation. This review of a Change Request ensures that the requested change fits in&#xD;
    with current systems and standards.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This review is equivalent to that for the Business Case. The Business Case sets the stage for an implementation&#xD;
    project, as does the review of a Change Request. Once a Change Request is approved, the next step is to define and&#xD;
    implementation project; to define a Project Charter, after which the normal project-related reviews kick-in.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Gates in the Context of Inputs and Outputs&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    UAM processes define IT architectures, but these architectures cannot be done independently of the enterprise's short&#xD;
    and long-term goals, standards,&amp;nbsp;and strategies as defined in these documents. The following illustrates the main&#xD;
    Work Products in UAM along with these external inputs. It also shows the approximate dependency relationships between&#xD;
    them and the &quot;gates&quot; where they are reviewed and approved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Main UAM inputs and Work Products and approximate relationships&quot; src=&quot;./resources/overview.png&quot; />&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There&amp;nbsp;are many more detailed Work Products defined (e.g., Business Process Model), but the above&#xD;
    illustrates&amp;nbsp;the important relationships. Note that the view is that the &quot;Project Charter&quot;, which defines the&#xD;
    general scope and objectives of an implementation project, is deemed to be external. This includes projects to define&#xD;
    IT architectures, which managers of IT architects&amp;nbsp;define.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to this overview of UAM inputs and outputs, the following figure summarizes the important involvement of IT&#xD;
    architects in defining system architectures. The various project management artifacts are listed, along with the&#xD;
    &quot;gates&quot; or reviews of these artifacts. IT architects participate in these reviews.&#xD;
