  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT architect that develop UAM architecture need to obtain an in-depth knowledge of the portion of the business&#xD;
    being modeled. They must rely on business experts for guidance and advice. This advice is provided during the&#xD;
    development of architectures, normally at the Business level and sometimes at the Logical level, in order to ensure&#xD;
    that the architectures are accurate reflections of the future state of the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;business experts involved have an intimate knowledge of the current business process and ideally some&#xD;
    knowledge of the desired future state of the business. The level of detail desired and required depends upon the size&#xD;
    and complexity of the &quot;system&quot;, namely the context of the IT architecture.&#xD;
