    Current Status&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NCCoE published a short guide with recommendations to help MSPs conduct, maintain, and test backup files to reduce&#xD;
    the impact of data loss incidents, such as ransomware. A more detailed guide is available here. See the Quick Planning&#xD;
    Tools section below for more information.&#xD;

    Summary&lt;br />&#xD;
    Many small and medium sized businesses use managed service providers (MSPs) to remotely manage their organizationâ€™s IT&#xD;
    infrastructure, cybersecurity, and related business operations. As a result, MSPs have become an attractive target for&#xD;
    cyber criminals. When an MSP is vulnerable to a cyber attack, it also increases the vulnerability to the small or&#xD;
    medium sized businesses an MSP supports. This page offers guidance to MSPs on how to improve cybersecurity by&#xD;
    implementing key security controls that reduces vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NCCoE developed recommendations that will enable MSPs to adopt cybersecurity technologies and techniques to improve&#xD;
    security for themselves and their small- and medium-sized business customers. MSPs can apply or customize the&#xD;
    recommendations to fit their cybersecurity needs. The publications below offer implementation recommendations, a&#xD;
    reference architecture, and details specific technologies/capabilities MSPs should consider deploying.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Quick Planning Tools&lt;br />&#xD;
    Backup Planning: Data loss incidents, whether a ransomware attack, hardware failure, or accidental or intentional data&#xD;
    destruction, can have catastrophic effects on MSPs and their customers. The NCCoE developed recommendations to help&#xD;
    MSPs conduct, maintain, and test backup files to reduce the impact of these data loss incidents. A one-page summary of&#xD;
    these recommendations can be accessed here.&#xD;
