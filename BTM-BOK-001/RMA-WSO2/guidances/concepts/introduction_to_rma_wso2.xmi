    As APIs, microservices, software as a service (SaaS), and serverless architectures evolve, integration is not fading&#xD;
    away; instead almost every new application involves integration across an exploding set of endpoints. The microservices&#xD;
    mantra of smart endpoints and dumb pipes fundamentally addresses a deeper problem. Integration must learn from code to&#xD;
    become immutable, type safe, testable, continuously built and deployed so they are more robust, resilient and above all&#xD;
    - agile.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;strong>What is the goal of MRA-WSO2?&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    MRA-WSO2 formalizes an approach to achieve a particular goal i.e.&amp;nbsp;to make an organization &lt;strong>integration&#xD;
    agile&lt;/strong>. The proposed methodology is an iterative process characterized by five stages. Additionally, the&#xD;
    methodology defined in this document looks at the organizational improvements in three dimensions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The methodology does not expect an organization to start from scratch, but rather to first conduct an assessment to&#xD;
    understand the current state and define a path to move to the next desired level. This document outlines a meta-process&#xD;
    for organizations to refer to when they want to become integration agile.&#xD;
