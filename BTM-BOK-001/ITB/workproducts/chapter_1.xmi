    Introduction&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    How do businesses and not-for-profit organizations help create our standard of living?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the sectors of the business environment, and how do changes in them influence business decisions?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the primary features of the world’s economic systems, and how are the three sectors of the U.S. economy&#xD;
    linked?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do economic growth, full employment, price stability, and inflation indicate a nation’s economic health?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How does the government use monetary policy and fiscal policy to achieve its macroeconomic goals?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the basic microeconomic concepts of demand and supply, and how do they establish prices?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the four types of market structure?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Which trends are reshaping the business, microeconomic, and macroeconomic environments and competitive arena?&lt;br />&#xD;
    This module provides the basic structures upon which the business world is built: how it is organized, what outside&#xD;
    forces influence it, and where it is heading. It also explores how the world’s economies and governments shape economic&#xD;
    activity. Each day in the United States, thousands of new businesses are born. Only a rare few will become the next&#xD;
    Apple, Google, or Amazon. Unfortunately, many others will never see their first anniversary. The survivors are those&#xD;
    that understand that change is the one constant in the business environment. Those organizations pay attention to the&#xD;
    business environment in which they operate and the trends that affect all businesses and then successfully adapt to&#xD;
    those trends. In this module, we will meet many businesses, both large and small, profit and not-for-profit, that&#xD;
    prosper because they track trends and use them to identify potential opportunities. This ability to manage change is a&#xD;
    critical factor in separating the success stories from the tales of business failure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We begin our study of business by introducing you to the primary functions of a business, the relationship between risk&#xD;
    and profits, and the importance of not-for-profit organizations. We’ll also examine the major components of the&#xD;
    business environment and how changing demographic, social, political and legal, and competitive factors affect all&#xD;
    business organizations. Next, we’ll explore how economies provide jobs for workers and also compete with other&#xD;
    businesses to create and deliver products to consumers. You will also learn how governments attempt to influence&#xD;
    economic activity through policies such as lowering or raising taxes. Next, we discuss how supply and demand determine&#xD;
    prices for goods and services. Finally, we conclude by examining key trends in the business environment, economic&#xD;
    systems, and the competitive environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Team Rubicon: Disaster Relief and a Sense of Purpose&lt;br />&#xD;
    Accounting for a substantial amount of economic activity in the United States, not-for-profits are an undeniable force&#xD;
    in the business world, even though their focus on goals other than profit falls outside the traditional model of a&#xD;
    for-profit business. But it is this shift away from a focus on profit that allows them to pursue missions of social&#xD;
    improvement and contributions to society as a whole. To be truly effective in a not-for-profit organization, a person&#xD;
    must share the organization’s vision.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The vision for Team Rubicon was shaped by its cofounders, Jake Wood and William McNulty, who saw the devastation caused&#xD;
    by the Haiti earthquake in 2010 and sprang into action. Both marines, Wood and McNulty knew they could do something to&#xD;
    help in this devastating and chaotic situation. Within 24 hours, they enlisted the help of six other military veterans&#xD;
    and first responders, gathered donations and supplies from friends and family, and made their way to Haiti to help with&#xD;
    disaster relief, and Team Rubicon was born.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The organization gets its name from the Rubicon, a river in northern Italy that Julius Caesar and his troops crossed on&#xD;
    their epic march to Rome, with the river marking the point of no return. The name underscores the cofounders’&#xD;
    experiences during the Haitian disaster, where despite advice from government officials and other aid organizations not&#xD;
    to proceed, their small team crossed into Haiti from the Dominican Republic carrying crucial gear and medical supplies&#xD;
    to thousands of earthquake victims.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Seven years later, Team Rubicon’s mission is twofold: to pair the skills and experiences of military veterans with&#xD;
    first responders to hit the ground running in any type of disaster and to provide a sense of community and&#xD;
    accomplishment to veterans who have served their country proudly but may be struggling as a result of their war&#xD;
    experiences.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    According to the organization’s mission statement, Team Rubicon seeks to provide veterans three things they sometimes&#xD;
    lose after leaving the military: a purpose, gained through disaster relief; a sense of community, built by serving with&#xD;
    others; and a feeling of self-worth from recognizing the impact one individual can make when dealing with natural&#xD;
    disasters.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Headquartered in the Los Angeles area, Team Rubicon is staffed by more than 60 employees who work in 10 regions around&#xD;
    the country, along with more than 40,000 volunteers ready to deploy within 24 hours. Similar to company operations in&#xD;
    for-profit organizations, staff positions at Team Rubicon include regional administrators; field operations (including&#xD;
    membership and training); marketing, communications, and social media; fundraising and partnership development; finance&#xD;
    and accounting; and people operations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Team Rubicon’s staff members bring professional and/or military experience to their daily jobs, but they all share the&#xD;
    organization’s vision. Many staff members started as volunteers for Team Rubicon while working in for-profit careers,&#xD;
    while others took advantage of the organization’s strong internship program to become familiar with its mission and&#xD;
    focus on disaster relief.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In 2016, Team Rubicon trained 8,000 military veterans and first responders in disaster relief and responded to 46&#xD;
    disasters, which required more than 85,000 volunteer hours. In addition to donations from individuals and corporations,&#xD;
    Team Rubicon relies on its partnerships with other organizations, such as Southwest Airlines, which supplies hundreds&#xD;
    of free plane tickets each year to fly volunteers to disaster sites.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Team Rubicon actively engages its nationwide community at every level of the organization, from volunteer to board&#xD;
    member, and every step of its operation: from training to planning to implementation to seeking donations and&#xD;
    volunteers to help with any type of disaster relief. Over the past several years, Team Rubicon has been recognized as&#xD;
    one of the top nonprofits to work for by The NonProfit Times, based on employee surveys and business partners’ input&#xD;
    about the organization’s work environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The not-for-profit world may not be for everyone, but if its growth is any indication within the overall economy, it&#xD;
    does appeal to many. With a resolve to assist those in need, including both disaster victims and returning military&#xD;
    personnel, Team Rubicon offers opportunities for those interested in nonprofit careers as well as those passionate&#xD;
    about helping others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
