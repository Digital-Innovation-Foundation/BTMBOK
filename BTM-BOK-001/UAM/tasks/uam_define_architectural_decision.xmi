  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this activity is to create an Architecture Decision (AD), specifically to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the context of the problem, issue or decision;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the constraints, imposed by existing architecture, enterprise standards or others;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the rationale for the decision, through a well researched summary of the facts;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Extract the implications of the AD, on current systems, future systems, support aspects and other aspects;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the specifics of the decision.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity results in the production of an AD. The diagram illustrates the main inputs and outputs of this activity&#xD;
    as hinted at above. A problem context helps to define the scope of the AD, and the constraints (imposed by technology,&#xD;
    the current situation, etc.) along with the rational (that is very much local to the business and the context) help in&#xD;
    arriving at and defining the decision. Implications of this decision, on the business and the current situation, are&#xD;
    also extracted and defined.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is explained in more detail in the descriptions of the steps involved.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    The objective here is to define the context of the problem, the environment within which the problem is found. This&#xD;
    includes business level context, such as processes and functions involved with the problem. The scope of the problem is&#xD;
    also described, that is, is it local to a system or process, does it span the business domain, or is it a problem that&#xD;
    involves the complete enterprise?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    The context and scope help the stakeholders to understand and agree upon the intention of the solution. The same&#xD;
    problem, interpreted for different contexts, can yield very different solutions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    The context and scope defines the intended area in which the solution will be deployed (e.g. workgroup, division,&#xD;
    department, entire business, etc.) and a definition of the users of the solution. If the context is well understood, a&#xD;
    short description may suffice, but for new technologies or processes a more complete description of the problem space&#xD;
    may be needed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    If the new solution is an enhancement to an existing system or solution, the existing solution should be described.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_lJ0OQMUYEdyVgeP6fyp1bg" name="Identify and Define the Constraints" guid="_lJ0OQMUYEdyVgeP6fyp1bg">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    Express the constraints under which the solution is decided upon. These constraints impact risk and cost. They could be&#xD;
    things like external interfaces that the solution must adhere to, standards, certifications, or a technical approach&#xD;
    employed for strategic reasons, such as using a certain database technology, or distribution mechanisms. Time&#xD;
    constraints and financial constraints are also identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_qYHfIMUYEdyVgeP6fyp1bg" name="Define the Rationale" guid="_qYHfIMUYEdyVgeP6fyp1bg">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    Describe options for the solution—optional approaches, capabilities or features and associated costs and benefits—and&#xD;
    options in approaching or deploying the solution. Solution options might include differing technical solutions,&#xD;
    differing mixes of options for technical solutions, differing mixes of 'make' and 'buy', and so on. In each case, the&#xD;
    effect of the option on the financial forecast, and on constraints (in turn impacting risk) should be described.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    The objective is to provide enough information on the options to substantiate the decision. Remember that this&#xD;
    description must stand on its own and be easily understood by a manager or architect reading it in 6 to 12 months or&#xD;
    more—in other words it needs to be readable out of context and complete in its coverage.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    Describe in detail the decision taken—include details on the solution and any other information that may be relevant,&#xD;
    such as the timeframe of the decision (i.e. short or long term), and any implementation or migration aspects, for&#xD;
    example.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    The implications of the decision are described. They include things such as financial, maintenance, operations or&#xD;
    configuration changes or constraints, usually affecting current systems, operations or processes. Implications on other&#xD;
    decisions and on future plans should also be described.&#xD;

  <purpose>The purpose of this activity is to define an architectural decision. Documenting important architectural decisions provides&#xD;
a repository of decision that will help guide other architects, managers and implementors in being compliant with&#xD;
enterprise and business domain standards and solutions. The provided repository of decisions&amp;nbsp;is also a source of&#xD;
information for re-visiting decisions over time.</purpose>
