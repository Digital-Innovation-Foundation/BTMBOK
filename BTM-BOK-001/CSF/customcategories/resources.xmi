    If your resource is publicly available on the Internet, accurate, and comprehensive for a given dimension of the NICE&#xD;
    Framework, and freely available for others to use (we welcome free resources from for-profit entities), it meets the&#xD;
    basic criteria for inclusion on the NICE Framework Resource Center. Pay-for resources associated with non-profit&#xD;
    entities also meet the basic criteria for inclusion. If your resource qualifies and you would like it listed as a NICE&#xD;
    Framework resource, send a description of your resource to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:NICEFramework@nist.gov&quot;>&lt;u>&lt;font&#xD;
    color=&quot;#0066cc&quot;>NICEFramework@nist.gov&lt;/font>&lt;/u>&lt;/a>.&#xD;
