    People and their ability to define solutions by understanding the current situation is the most important thing for an&#xD;
    organization. Culture and the organizational structure control the way people operate, and it is the platform for&#xD;
    enabling people’s productivity. Culture plays an important role in adapting to change. Habits and best practices&#xD;
    inherited from an organization’s culture are more powerful than those merely enforced by policies.&#xD;

    The organizational and decision-making structure affects how innovative ideas from each part of the organization are&#xD;

    structure&lt;/strong>, which allows organizations to become adaptive, innovative and agile. People (organization &amp;amp;&#xD;
    culture) must move from sequential waterfall and waterfall-agile approaches which include siloed “center of excellence”&#xD;
    teams, to a fundamentally decentralized set of agile teams. In a podular structure, each of these teams then own the&#xD;
    responsibility for building, running and managing their integration applications. One of the main characteristics of a&#xD;
    podular organization structure is each pod act as an individual business unit which allows to operate and take&#xD;
    decisions independently as well as add the people with the required skills to the team.&#xD;
