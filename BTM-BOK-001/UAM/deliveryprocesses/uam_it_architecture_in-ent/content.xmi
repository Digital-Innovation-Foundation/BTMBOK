    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The deliverables from UAM include a number of models at various levels, along with a set of Architectural Decisions.&#xD;
    These deliverables were developed to influence the direction of IT development within the enterprise in support of the&#xD;
    business. How are these UAM models and decisions applied within an enterprise? They are applied through IT architect&#xD;
    participation at various points in the enterprise’s processes, specifically their&amp;nbsp;IT governance and IT project&#xD;
    processes. This section generically defines where UAM implementation (application of results) governance is applied,&#xD;
    which requires adaptation and integration into your specific enterprise. They are outside the scope of the methodology,&#xD;
    which focuses on how to do IT architecture, but are necessary to properly integrate UAM into the enterprise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Three possible areas exist where UAM deliverables (and by extension the knowledge and expertise of the architects) are&#xD;
    applied to both advance the goals of the enterprise and to apply the architecture results to the enterprise. These&#xD;
    three areas are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Enterprise Planning&lt;/strong> – the target architecture along with a migration plan are used to help make&#xD;
        planning decisions. What projects will benefit the enterprise in the coming year or quarter? This is obviously just&#xD;
        one input, but an important one, into the (yearly or quarterly) enterprise business planning exercise.&#xD;
        Recommendations are based upon the migration plan as well as new or revised Architectural Decisions. This is a&#xD;
        strategic level planning activity.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>IT Projects&lt;/strong> – IT architecture and architectural reviews are built into the enterprise’s program&#xD;
        management, project planning and project management processes. This is a tactical level planning activity.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>IT Evolution&lt;/strong> – the evolution of the IT environment is kept in-line with the target architecture.&#xD;
        This is an IT project and release planning exercise, and an operational level planning activity. The state of&#xD;
        system at each point in the migration path must be operationally viable and cost-effective.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Normally these three processes have reviews (or gates) included where input from IT architects (and others) is included&#xD;
    as part of the process. Each gate provides for the participation of and input from IT architects and others regarding&#xD;
    the impacts or opportunities presented by the strategies and plans. A short list of possible &lt;em>impacts&lt;/em> resulting&#xD;
    from this review includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Changes to the enterprise’s (IT) strategy;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Additions or modifications to the IT architecture;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Additions, deletions or modification to standards defined in Architectural Decisions;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Follow-on impacts from the above such as skills requirements (for IT people and business people), organizational&#xD;
        changes, etc.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A short list of possible &lt;em>opportunities&lt;/em> includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Application of new or existing architectural patterns to the advantage of the enterprise and its plans;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Application of new technologies to address new (business) requirements, opportunities or directions;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Application of new technologies that will leverage plans or expand them, all to the advantage of the enterprise.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This list is not exhaustive, but suffice it to say that there are many opportunities for IT architects to contribute to&#xD;
    the definition of strategies and plans for the business. They are well placed to contribute due to their in-depth&#xD;
    knowledge of the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    Projects are implemented by application of a project development cycle within the enterprise. Normally this project&#xD;

    or gate reviews provide the governance required for ensuring that projects both leverage existing architectural&#xD;
    definitions and decisions, and conform to architectural and technical standards, as defined in the IT architecture&#xD;

    plans; for example, the size and scope of new strategies or business opportunities, and their impact on the&#xD;

    existingexistingThe evolution of the existing IT environment is managed from an IT architecture perspective (and other&#xD;
    perspectives). Change requests define a need for change to existing systems, which is a good point to inject enterprise&#xD;
    standards and enterprise or departmental architectural patterns into the planning for the next steps. The change&#xD;
    management process within the enterprise needs to include an architectural review prior to the initiation of a change&#xD;
    implementation project.&#xD;
