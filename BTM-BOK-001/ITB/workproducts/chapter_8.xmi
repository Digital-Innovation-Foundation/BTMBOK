    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    How do firms recruit applicants?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do firms select qualified applicants?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What types of training and development do organizations offer their employees?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How are performance appraisals used to evaluate employee performance?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the types of compensation and methods for paying workers?&lt;br />&#xD;

    issues?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How are grievances between management and labor resolved, and what tactics are used to force a contract&#xD;
    settlement?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the key laws and federal agencies affecting human resource management and labor relations?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What trends and issues are affecting human resource management and labor relations?&lt;br />&#xD;
    This chapter looks at the role of human resources within an organization, from the general processes of developing and&#xD;
    planning to the more specific tasks of employee evaluation and compensation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Human resource management and labor relations involve acquisition, development, use, and maintenance of a human&#xD;
    resource mix (people and positions) to achieve strategic organizational goals and objectives. Successful human resource&#xD;
    management is based on a company’s ability to attract and hire the best employees, equip them with the knowledge and&#xD;
    skills they need to excel, compensate them fairly, and motivate them to reach their full potential and perform at high&#xD;
    levels. Today’s business environment presents numerous challenges to effectively managing employees:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Technology continues to advance, which places great importance on knowledge workers, especially when demand outstrips&#xD;
    the supply of high-talent individuals.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Global business operations involve rapid data transfer and necessitate accelerated decision-making by executive and&#xD;
    technical employees.&lt;br />&#xD;
    The workforce is increasingly more diversified and multicultural, which places increased emphasis on communication and&#xD;
    cultural understanding.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Work, life, and family priorities are more difficult to balance as dual-worker families populate the labor force.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Employment and labor laws continue to greatly influence employee recruitment and hiring, compensation decisions, and&#xD;
    employee retention and turnover in both union and nonunion organizations.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Each day, human resource experts and front-line supervisors deal with these challenges while sharing responsibility for&#xD;
    attracting and retaining skilled, motivated employees. Whether faced with a large or small human resources problem,&#xD;
    supervisors need some understanding of difficult employee-relations issues, especially if there are legal implications.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this chapter, you will learn about the elements of the human resource management process, including human resource&#xD;
    planning and job analysis and design, employee recruitment and selection, training and development of employees,&#xD;
    performance planning and evaluation, and compensation of the workforce. The chapter also describes labor unions and&#xD;
    their representation of millions of American workers in construction, manufacturing, transportation, and service-based&#xD;
    industries.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Andrea Herran, Human Resources Consultant&lt;br />&#xD;
    In college, Andrea Herran studied business administration and minored in psychology. Always interested in a business&#xD;
    career, she initially took psychology simply because it was interesting. Little did she know how applicable that minor&#xD;
    would become. As a human resources (HR) consultant, she often benefits from her psychology background. “Studying human&#xD;
    behavior really gave me the background necessary to put myself in the position of others, to see things from their&#xD;
    point of view, which has definitely been helpful in my career in human resources.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Herran started out as an administrative assistant in the HR department of a hotel, and her career has run the gamut of&#xD;
    human resources over the 25 years since she graduated from college. She has been an employment coordinator, focusing on&#xD;
    employee recruitment and selection, and a personnel manager, where she learned the skills necessary to maintain and&#xD;
    evaluate employees. As a training manager, she sharpened her talent for developing, coordinating, and even&#xD;
    administering staff training. Eventually, she became the director of human resources for companies both in the United&#xD;
    States and abroad. Indeed, beyond the United States, she has worked in Mexico, Argentina, and South Africa.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Andrea worked her way up in the corporate world, but entrepreneurship was more consistent with her desire for a&#xD;
    fast-paced, changing environment, both in terms of what she does and who she works with, so she made the move to&#xD;
    consulting. “Consulting allows me to draw upon all my human resources skills. I have opened five HR departments in my&#xD;
    career, so I bring my full experience to bear on the challenges each company has.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Today, Andrea’s passion is working with small businesses, entrepreneurs, managers, and owners as an advisor to&#xD;
    “uncomplicate the people side of your business.” As the principal of Focus HR Consulting, she advises firms how to set&#xD;
    up human resource programs and ensure legal compliance. She also provides leadership coaching and training and mentors&#xD;
    employees. She has worked in several industries, including hospitality (hotels and restaurants), advertising,&#xD;
    professional services, logistics, technology, and manufacturing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When Andrea was hired by Aquion Water Treatment Products, she was tasked with updating the company’s HR policies and&#xD;
    procedures. The company’s performance reviews were very task-oriented versus behavior-oriented. Instead of determining&#xD;
    whether a task was completed, behavior-oriented reviews seek to evaluate not only whether the person completed the task&#xD;
    but also how he or she did so, especially examining the interactions involved in the task. Is an employee punctual at&#xD;
    returning consumer request calls? How does he or she relate to customers? As a manager, does he or she express thoughts&#xD;
    clearly? “By evaluating specific behaviors, you create an environment with clearly set qualifications for advancement&#xD;
    and opportunities for targeted employee development. Without this, the human aspect of human resources can be&#xD;
    overlooked.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Andrea has never looked back on her choice to become an entrepreneur, and she believes her varied employment history&#xD;
    was a key to her success. “Anyone interested in this field should experience as many possibilities within human&#xD;
    resources as possible. You leave school with the theory, but only through experience do you really get to see what the&#xD;
    potential of such a career is.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
