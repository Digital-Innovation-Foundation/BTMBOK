  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Business Event is something that happens internally or externally to the system that drives the activities and&#xD;
    processes of the system being modeled. Several types of events are defined. A Start Event represents a significant&#xD;
    occurrence in the activities of the business that requires immediate action, normally triggering actions within a&#xD;
    Business Activity. A Start Event can be anything from a timer, a trigger in a data base, a user action of some sort, or&#xD;
    the arrival or modification of a Business Entity or other artifact. Note that this generic&amp;nbsp;Business Event element&#xD;
    is abstract and is therefore not instantiated within Business Process Models.&#xD;

    A Business Event is something that happens internally or externally to the system that drives the activities and&#xD;
    processes of the system being modeled. This is the generic abstract representation of any type of event at the business&#xD;
    level. It is not instantiated and therefore the generic Start Event, End Event or Timer Start Event are used to capture&#xD;
    events. See:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;./../../UAM/guidances/supportingmaterials/uam_references_229FFDF2.html&quot;&#xD;
