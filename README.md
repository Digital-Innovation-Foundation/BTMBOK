Business Technology Management Body of Knowledge (BTM BOK)
============================================================

**Summary**

BTM BOK is a guide to the unified professions responsible to lead Digital Transformation and Digital Innovation (DT/DI) projects. 

BTM is a broader definition of DT/DI professional roles. It still includes primarily the traditional IS/IT management practices, generally located within the Chief Information Officer (CIO) branch. But BTM also integrates Out-of-IT roles, such as Chief Digital Officer (CDO), Digital Product Manager, Digital Marketing, Data Scientists, etc. It is also concerned about digital literacy among all other professional roles involved in DT/DI projects.

BOK assets are delivered in a single Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) Method Library and Wiki, and reuse primarily 100+ CC BY-SA, EPL 1.0, & EUPL 1.2 references, with some under freer licenses such as CC-BY, Apache, and MIT.

**Practices**

BTM BOK doesn't reinvent the wheel, but instead intends to connect readily existing industry certifications and standards. We focus on specifications covering the whole range of Digital Transformation roles and tasks.

**References**

We reuse contents from several academic and professional projects, whether from vendors, governments, associations, universities, or open source initiatives.
