  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The retail sector is an important part of the U.S. economy. Cybersecurity incidents affecting consumer-facing&#xD;
    businesses can threaten the national and economic security of the United States by harming the financial security of&#xD;
    companies and the public, weakening consumer confidence, eroding individual privacy protections, and damaging the brand&#xD;
    value and reputation of businesses.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Multifactor Authentication for E-Commerce&lt;br />&#xD;
    Current Status&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NCCoE released a final version of NIST Special Publication (SP) 1800-17 Multifactor Authentication for E-Commerce&#xD;
    on July 30, 2019.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Summary&lt;br />&#xD;
    Smart chip credit cards and terminals work together to protect in-store payments. These in-store security advances were&#xD;
    introduced in 2015, and have pushed malicious actors who possess stolen credit card data to perform payment card fraud&#xD;
    online. Because online retailers cannot utilize all of the benefits of improved credit card technology, they should&#xD;
    consider implementing stronger authentication to reduce the risk of electronic commerce (e-commerce) fraud.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In collaboration with stakeholders in the retail sector, the NCCoE published a practice guide that explores risk-based&#xD;
    scenarios to trigger the use of multifactor authentication (MFA) to help reduce fraudulent online purchases. In the&#xD;
    project’s example implementations, if certain risk elements (contextual data related to the transaction) are exceeded&#xD;
    that could indicate an increased likelihood of fraudulent activity during the online shopping session, the purchaser&#xD;
    will be prompted to present another distinct authentication factor—something the purchaser has—in addition to the&#xD;
    username and password.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NCCoE’s practice guide to Multifactor Authentication for E-Commerce can help your organization:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    reduce online fraudulent purchases, including those resulting from the use of credential stuffing to take over&#xD;
    accounts&lt;br />&#xD;
    show customers that the organization is committed to its security&lt;br />&#xD;
    protect your e-commerce systems&lt;br />&#xD;
    provide greater situational awareness&lt;br />&#xD;
    avoid system-administrator-account takeover through phishing&lt;br />&#xD;
    implement the example solutions by using our step-by-step guide&lt;br />&#xD;

    Collaborating Vendors&lt;br />&#xD;
    Organizations participating in this project submitted their capabilities in response to an open call in the Federal&#xD;
    Register for all sources of relevant security capabilities from academia and industry (vendors and integrators). The&#xD;
    following respondents with relevant capabilities or product components (identified as “Technology&#xD;
    Partners/Collaborators” herein) signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to collaborate with NIST in a&#xD;
    consortium to build this example solution.&lt;br />&#xD;
