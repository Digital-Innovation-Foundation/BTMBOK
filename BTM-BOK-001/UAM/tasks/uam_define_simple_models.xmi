  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This simplified approach to producing an architecture does not come without a cost. Important analysis is not done, and&#xD;
    therefore detail will be missing or aspects not examined properly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This approach is faster because it leverages existing information such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Documentation on existing systems;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Documentation on existing architectures;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Documented and relevant architectural decisions;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Enterprise or industry architectural patterns.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This approach simplifies the documentation required for the architecture, namely fewer models and simpler models. The&#xD;
    &quot;simple&quot; IT architecture is typically focused on one or two aspects; &lt;em>Location&lt;/em> for example, to re-architect the&#xD;
    IP network.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>: Simple models are only defined at the Logical or Technical level since existing&#xD;
    documentation may not include the business level, and the focus is at the Logical or Technical levels due to the&#xD;
    urgency and time constraints placed on the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>This approach should only be followed if there is real urgency, since many valuable steps are skipped or analysis is&#xD;
limited&amp;nbsp;and therefore detail will be missing from the final result. It's a question of balancing the risk of not&#xD;
completing the architecture in time versus leaving out important analysis that may come back to cause problems down the&#xD;
road.</keyConsiderations>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The context for this&amp;nbsp;task is defined by the Business Scope, existing architectures or system&#xD;
    descriptions,&amp;nbsp;and the Architectural Decisions Summary just produced. This is the set of existing information that&#xD;
    now needs to be analyzed in detail and leveraged to produce the required architecture. The output from the analysis&#xD;
    will be a set of architectural components to be used in the new architecture,&amp;nbsp;which can then be organized into a&#xD;
    consistent and well-structured IT architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;architectural components are extracted&amp;nbsp;from existing documentation including existing IT&#xD;
    architectures.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>Typically the Business level is omitted since these IT architectures are often focused at the Logical level or even&#xD;
only at&amp;nbsp;the Technical level. The down-side is that this will severely limit traceability of the architecture back to&#xD;
business requirements.&lt;br /></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The set of architectural components to be used are now structured in terms of interdependencies and interactions,&#xD;
    completing the summary of the architecture. This structuring also needs to comply with the architectural pattern(s)&#xD;
    chosen as applicable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The end result is then analyzed to ensure that it is complete and consistent.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Corrections are made for consistency problems, then any gaps in the architecture are identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Missing components are&amp;nbsp;defined and placed into the proper context and relationships within the model.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <purpose>Many times there is pressure to quickly advance a new or revised architecture, for business reasons or due to external&#xD;
environmental pressures. This task defines a way to accomplish this, mainly by leveraging existing work and simplifying the&#xD;
output.</purpose>
