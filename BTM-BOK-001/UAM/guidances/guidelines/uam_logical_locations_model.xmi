&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/concepts/uam_it_architecture_193573CD.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_XTWLgN_kEdynr9jlfK-aMA&quot;>Concept: IT Architecture&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;find the idea of &lt;em>viewpoints (views&lt;/em>&#xD;
    and &lt;em>aspects)&lt;/em> from which an system can be modeled. Location is one of the aspects, or vertical slices through&#xD;
    the system, that defines and models a perspective that is useful in understanding the system and its operation. In the&#xD;
    Unified Architecture Method (UAM), the purpose of&amp;nbsp;a Location Model&amp;nbsp;is to capture the decomposition of the&#xD;
    system into locations that host business activities. This is done at several levels of abstraction, namely Business&#xD;
    Location (the most abstract), Logical Location, and Technical Location (the least abstract, at which actual technical&#xD;
    standards for hardware and software are described).&amp;nbsp;The following is an introduction to the Logical Locations&#xD;
    Model&lt;i>.&lt;/i>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the &lt;em>logical&lt;/em> level described here, the notion of location is used to identify and describe in detail the&#xD;
    classes of location at which the system has a presence. Computational aspects are added, such as &lt;em>server&lt;/em>,&#xD;
    &lt;em>storage&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>network&lt;/em>. The Logical Locations Model supports this viewpoint by describing what business&#xD;
    activities are carried on at the defined locations, and organizes them into a simple model. See: &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_logical_pers_1ABDA187.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_aiIn4Ou6Edytvcf-4U2D3Q&quot;>Guideline: Logical Perspective&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>&lt;u>Note&lt;/u>:&lt;/strong> Since UAM&amp;nbsp;may&amp;nbsp;be used to model&amp;nbsp;the complete enterprise (or business&#xD;
        domain), the level of detail to be included in this model is a judgment call of the architect, based upon:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN-LEFT: 2em&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The objective of the architecture effort&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The size of the enterprise or (business line)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Time and resource constraints&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The locations model works best if layering is used to deal with complexity, and to provide views appropriate for the&#xD;
    audience and objectives; and comprehension is greatly improved. Detail is hidden, while allowing for it to be defined&#xD;
    in lower layers, as required to meet the objectives of the architecture effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Location Design&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following procedure helps determine a realistic approach (mainly for a &quot;green field&quot;; existing systems or&#xD;
    enterprises may have clear definitions for locations and deployment of services):&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Look at each activity to see how the involved actors should be physically located in order to optimally perform the&#xD;
        tasks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Consider&amp;nbsp;the needs of equipment and premises for each actor.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Look at the whole system and related activities, and consider: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Which actors participate in several activities?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Which activities make use of each other's results?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        With this as a basis, identify the optimal location of each activity and actor.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Compare this with the current situation and ask yourself: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What is a realistic change within the mandate of the project?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What is the most cost-effective location?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What is mandatory? What can the organization live without?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What can be compensated for by having the right equipment?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What can be compensated for by having the right location?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Consider the effect of relocating an entire system on the activities/processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Estimate the cost per business process to change the location according to what you have discovered. Determine&#xD;
        whether the investment is realistic.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, a mobile data solution must be considered for a sales person who needs direct access to company databases&#xD;
    while at the customer's offices. Having video-conferencing equipment installed sometimes compensates for the&#xD;
    disadvantage of having the members of a development team located at different sites.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Localities and Connections&quot; name=&quot;Localities and Connections&quot;>Locations and Connections&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A locality expresses notionally where business process are supported, thus there is a strong connection between&#xD;
    &lt;em>logical location&lt;/em> and &lt;em>logical activity&lt;/em>.&amp;nbsp;The semantics of locality implies a tighter grouping&#xD;
    of&amp;nbsp;activities without defining exact geographic locations, even at the logical level. Some details regarding how&#xD;
    the activity is to be supported is provided, since computational aspects are introduced in the logical models.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is conceivable for very complex, very large systems (i.e. the enterprise), that there might&amp;nbsp;be locations that&#xD;
    decompose to finer-grained localities, just as a system might contain subsystems. The description of a location&#xD;
    includes a general indication of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>type&lt;/i> of&amp;nbsp;location being defined (e.g., Headquarters, factory,&#xD;
    point-of-presence, etc.) along with the business activities supported&amp;nbsp;at the location. It is conceivable that&#xD;
    some&amp;nbsp;generalization or abstraction for locations could also be defined (along with the activities supported), the&#xD;
    generic notion of an ATM or other type of point-of-presence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Locations Model diagrams show how business processes are distributed across the system's locations, and how&#xD;
    they are connectedâ€”it illustrates the logical level connections between the locations. In the lower level &lt;em>Technical&#xD;
    Perspective&lt;/em>, to be developed based upon this logical level view, the location (and possible configuration) of&#xD;
    specific technical resources is defined, which is important when considering functional and non-functional&#xD;
    requirements. For many systems engineers, this is &quot;the architecture&quot;, this Logical and the Technical&#xD;
    level&amp;nbsp;views.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Locations Model consists of two elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Location&lt;/strong> - a location is a collection&amp;nbsp;of activities&amp;nbsp;(processes and tasks)&amp;nbsp;that&#xD;
        provide system services at that location.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Connections&lt;/strong> - pathways (for information, mass, energy, or discrete physical items) supporting the&#xD;
        required process interactions between locations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The semantics of the location diagrams are similar to those of UML deployment diagrams, and locations are represented&#xD;
    as stereotyped UML &lt;em>nodes&lt;/em>. In the UML standard, a node is a classifier that &quot;... is a physical object that&#xD;
    represents a processing resource, generally, having at least a memory and often processing capability as well. Nodes&#xD;
    include computing devices but also human resources or mechanical processing resources.&quot; Therefore, UML allows us to&#xD;
    extend the semantics of nodes, and the associations that connect them, through stereotyping and the application of&#xD;
    tagged values. This is used to define the locations, their attributes&amp;nbsp;and interconnections. The icon for&#xD;
    a&amp;nbsp;top-level Logical Location&amp;nbsp;is a building (see the illustration below).&amp;nbsp; Other modeling elements are&#xD;
    also defined that support the definition of servers, routers, telecommunications links and other useful notions at the&#xD;
    logical level, including &lt;em>domain&lt;/em> and &lt;em>zone&lt;/em>, see: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/whitepapers/uam_security_reference_model_3EA07B63.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_KGs_oMX8EdyDYN2-y9-AqA&quot;>Whitepaper: A Reference Model for Enterprise Security&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each location in the&amp;nbsp;locations&amp;nbsp;model has a description of additional non-functional aspects such as quality&#xD;
    (reliability, maintainability, safety, and so on), physical and environmental requirements, and development constraints&#xD;
    (cost, technical risk, and so forth). From these requirements, the actual characteristics (of each location) are&#xD;
    determined; obviously these are chosen to meet the explicit requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Locations are characterized with:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Activities&lt;/strong> - a list of the activities provided at the location, which relates directly to the&#xD;
        Business Process Model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Logical level non-functional requirements&lt;/strong> - things such as importance, reliability, survivability,&#xD;
        performance, capacity, and availability requirements of the location. These attributes may be different for each&#xD;
        business activity (and the supporting components) at a location.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Connections are characterized by the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Activities&lt;/strong> - the business activities that traverse the link and the supported protocols.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Logical level non-functional requirements&lt;/strong> - things such as volumes, importance, capacity, data&#xD;
        rate, survivability and availability requirements of the communications path.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Locality Diagrams&quot; name=&quot;Locality Diagrams&quot;>Location Diagrams&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you move to the Logical and Technical Locations Models, computing concepts are added to the locations model,&#xD;
    becoming more like traditional IP network models.&amp;nbsp;Business Locations may also be refined into more than one&#xD;
    Logical or Technical level location, as dictated by the requirements of the business. And&amp;nbsp;location models&amp;nbsp;can&#xD;
    represent quite disparate things, ultimately realized, for example, as a collection of hardware platforms (e.g.,&#xD;
    network routers etc.), part of a computational resource (e.g., ATM, servers and storage), or groups of collaborating&#xD;
    human resources (e.g. call-center).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The figure shows a Logical Location Model for an enterprise. The enterprise has a headquarters, a number of retail&#xD;
    stores, central warehouses, and a factory. See:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_diagrams_in_logical_pers_FA9238A.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_PxJUAOoZEdytvcf-4U2D3Q&quot;>Guideline: Logical Perspective Views&lt;/a>. Also note that the diagram shows that the&#xD;
    &lt;em>Headquarters&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Store&lt;/em> locations are separate &lt;em>domains&lt;/em>, but that the &lt;em>Factory&lt;/em> and&#xD;
    &lt;em>Warehouse&lt;/em> are &lt;em>zones&lt;/em>, see: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/whitepapers/uam_security_reference_model_3EA07B63.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_KGs_oMX8EdyDYN2-y9-AqA&quot;>Whitepaper: A Reference Model for Enterprise Security&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Headquarters Domain, Store Domain and Factory Zone&quot; src=&quot;./resources/Logical-Perspective_LLM1.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Layering may be used to advantage in logical&amp;nbsp;(and technical level) models, see &quot;Layer the Models&quot; in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/concepts/uam_complex_modelling_A4EC9E37.html#Layered%20Business%20Models&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_PjkWoObaEdyjVoHXO3Mbfg&quot;>Concept: Complex IT Architectures&lt;/a>. For example, a more detailed layer for&#xD;
    &quot;Headquarters&quot;, the next layer of detail for&amp;nbsp;it would appear in a sub-diagram as shown below. The &quot;drill down&quot;&#xD;
    decorator (&lt;img alt=&quot;Drill Down Decorator&quot; src=&quot;./resources/Drill-Down.png&quot; width=&quot;12&quot; height=&quot;12&quot; />) on&amp;nbsp;the&#xD;
    Headquarters location indicates that there is more&amp;nbsp;detail in another diagram, which is shown below.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Headquarters Domain expanded showing the core network&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/Logical-Perspective_LLM2.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>This view illustrates that there is a core network that interconnects the various &quot;zones&quot; or sub-networks together.&#xD;
This core network is in turn connected, through a Domain PEP and a Zone PEP to the Store and Warehouse locations&#xD;
respectively. Zones are typically defined based upon the functional divisions within the system or enterprise, as shown in&#xD;
the figure. However, non-functional considerations may influence how the zones (sub-networks) are defined.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
