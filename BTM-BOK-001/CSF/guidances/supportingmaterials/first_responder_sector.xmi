  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the United States, over 10,000 jurisdictions, from townships and cities to counties and states, employ public safety&#xD;
    personnel to respond to emergency situations. These first responders treat life-threatening injuries, keep natural&#xD;
    disasters at bay, and combat terrorism. To perform these duties, emergency responders must undergo unique training,&#xD;
    utilize specialized equipment, and access a variety of information systems. The NCCoE's Public Safety and First&#xD;
    Responder (PSFR) program is working with the first responder community to implement standards-based solutions to make&#xD;
    public safety systems resilient against attack and to ensure immediate access to critical assets during incident&#xD;
    response.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mobile Application Single Sign-On&lt;br />&#xD;
    Helps public safety and first responder personnel efficiently and securely gain access to mission data via mobile&#xD;
    devices and applications during times of emergency. Please download, read, and comment on our recently revised practice&#xD;
    guide.&#xD;
