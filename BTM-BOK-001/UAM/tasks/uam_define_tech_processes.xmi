    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The logical view of the business processes and tasks is further analyzed and a technical view created. We are creating&#xD;
    a model&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;logical level (see:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Architecture Perspectives and Viewpoints&lt;/a>) with a focus on the &lt;em>tasks&lt;/em> and &lt;em>activities&lt;/em> and how&#xD;
    they&amp;nbsp;define the business processes.What technical patterns, approaches and technologies will support the model,&#xD;
    will support the &lt;em>business&lt;/em>? &amp;nbsp;Document these Architectural Decisions, and verify through walk-throughs and&#xD;
    consultation with technical and business experts that the models and technologies will perform as required.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Processes are driven by events that the system must deal with. Look at these events and the processes that they&#xD;
    trigger. Identify the activities and processes and their sequence as the event is responded to, and model the&#xD;
    interactions between them and their inputs and outputs (in terms of&amp;nbsp;technical entities).&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>Describe the organization of the identified&amp;nbsp;activities and processes based upon cohesiveness and other grouping&#xD;
criteria. This is a refinement of the logical level model, with the addition of technical details, which may have an impact&#xD;
upon the structure of the tasks and processes. For example, a technical solution may require refactoring of the activities&#xD;
or processes. &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Other structures may be discovered, for example when the logical tasks are decomposed into more technical detail, there&#xD;
    may be activities or processes that are closely related or identical.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>Many logical level activities, when decomposed into more detailed technical level activities, may have activities in&#xD;
common, or even sub-processes in common. It may not be obvious, due to the vagarities of names and descriptions, therefore&#xD;
it is useful to have a look at the completed model from this perspective. Focusing on input and output artifacts is a&#xD;
useful approach.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>As an aid in the development of the Technical Locations Model, look for location dependencies within the activities and&#xD;
processes. Define these locations and the activities supported at them. Consulting the&amp;nbsp;Logical&amp;nbsp;Locations Model&#xD;
and Technical Locations Model&amp;nbsp;is also useful in that processes may span locations, which needs to be understood if&#xD;
they are to be properly supported and function correctly. Technical details discovered and related will aid in the&#xD;
technical design of both the Process and the Locations model.</sectionDescription>
