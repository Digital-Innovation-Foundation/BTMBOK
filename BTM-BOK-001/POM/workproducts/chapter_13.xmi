&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What is the nature of leadership and the leadership process?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the processes associated with people coming to leadership positions?&lt;br />&#xD;

    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    John Arroyo: Springfield Sea Lions&lt;br />&#xD;
    John Arroyo is thrilled with his new position as general manager of the Springfield Sea Lions, a minor league baseball&#xD;
    team in. Arroyo has been a baseball fan all of his life, and now his diligent work and his degree in sports management&#xD;
    are paying off.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Arroyo knew he had a hard act to follow. The general manager whom John replaced, “T.J.” Grevin, was a much-loved&#xD;
    old-timer who had been with the Sea Lions since their inception 14 years ago. John knew it would be difficult for&#xD;
    whoever followed T.J., but he didn’t realize how ostracized and powerless he would feel. He tried a pep talk: “I’m the&#xD;
    general manager—the CEO of this ball club! In time, the staff will respect me.” [Not a very good pep talk!]&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After his first season ends, Arroyo is discouraged. Ticket and concession sales are down, and some long-time employees&#xD;
    are rumored to be thinking about leaving. If John doesn’t turn things around, he knows his tenure with the Sea Lions&#xD;
    will be short.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Questions: Is John correct in assuming that the staff will learn to respect him in time? What can John do to earn the&#xD;
    loyalty of his staff and improve the ball club’s performance?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Outcomes: During the winter, John thinks long and hard about how he can earn the respect of the Sea Lions staff. Before&#xD;
    the next season opener, John announces his plan: “So I can better understand what your day is like, I’m going to spend&#xD;
    one day in each of your shoes. I’m trading places with each of you. I will be a ticket taker, a roving hot dog vendor,&#xD;
    and a janitor. And I will be a marketer, and an accountant—for a day. You in turn will have the day off so you can&#xD;
    enjoy the game from the general manager’s box.” The staff laughs and whistles appreciatively. Then the Springfield&#xD;
    mascot, Sparky the Sea Lion, speaks up: “Hey Mr. Arroyo, are you going to spend a day in my flippers?” “You bet!” says&#xD;
    John, laughing. The entire staff cheers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    John continues. “At the close of the season, we will honor a staff member with the T.J. Grevin Award for outstanding&#xD;
    contributions to the Sea Lions organization. T.J. was such a great guy, it’s only right that we honor him.” The meeting&#xD;
    ends, but John’s staff linger to tell him how excited they are about his ideas. Amidst the handshakes, he hopes that&#xD;
    this year may be the best year yet for the Sea Lions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sarah Elizabeth Roisland is the manager of a district claims office for a large insurance company. Fourteen people work&#xD;
    for her. The results of a recent attitude survey indicate that her employees have extremely high job satisfaction and&#xD;
    motivation. Conflict is rare in Sarah’s office. Furthermore, productivity measures place her group among the most&#xD;
    productive in the entire company. Her success has brought the company’s vice president of human resources to her office&#xD;
    in an attempt to discover the secret to her success. Sarah’s peers, superiors, and workers all give the same answer:&#xD;
    she is more than a good manager—she is an outstanding leader. She continually gets high performance from her employees&#xD;
    and does so in such a way that they enjoy working for her.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is no magic formula for becoming a good leader. There are, however, many identifiable reasons why some people are&#xD;
    better and more effective leaders. Leaders, especially effective leaders, are not created by simply attending a one-day&#xD;
    leadership workshop. Yet effective leadership skills are not something most people are born with. You can become an&#xD;
    effective leader if you are willing to invest the time and energy to develop all of the “right stuff.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    According to Louise Axon, director of content strategy, and her colleagues at Harvard Business Publishing, in seeking&#xD;
    management talent, leadership is an urgently needed quality in all managerial roles.1 Good leaders and good leadership&#xD;
    are rare. Harvard management professor John P. Kotter notes that “there is a leadership crisis in the U.S. today,”2 and&#xD;
    the late USC Professor Warren Bennis states that many of our organizations are overmanaged and underled.&#xD;
