    Projects are temporary and should therefore have a definite start and end. A project should be considered complete when
    it is determined that its goals and objectives have been accomplished. Once this happens, the project team should be
    disbanded.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Operations, on the other hand, comprises the ongoing day-to-day activities undertaken by a permanent organisation to
    deliver services or products.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    However, people often find themselves involved in so-called projects that have been going on for years, working with
    moving targets or a continuously expanded scope, which sometimes includes activities that should be classified as
    maintenance or operations. These are situations where the projects have been allowed to either become uncontrollable,
    or to move into operations (maintenance) mode.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    In most projects, the operations period begins after the projectâ€™s main products have been produced and accepted by the
    client.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    How do you recognise that a project has slipped into operations mode?
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            The main project deliverables have been produced and the client has accepted them
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            The main project output (deliverable) is in use
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            Support is provided to users
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            Maintenance activities are undertaken
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            Minor updates (improvements) are planned and implemented over time
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
