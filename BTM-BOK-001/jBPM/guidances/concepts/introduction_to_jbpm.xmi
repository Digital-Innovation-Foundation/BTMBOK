    What is jBPM?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    jBPM is a flexible Business Process Management (BPM) Suite. It is light-weight, fully open-source (distributed under&#xD;
    Apache License 2.0) and written in Java. It allows you to model, execute, and monitor business processes and cases&#xD;
    throughout their life cycle.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    A business process allows you to model your business goals by describing the steps that need to be executed to achieve&#xD;
    those goals, and the order of those goals is depicted using a flow chart. This process greatly improves the visibility&#xD;
    and agility of your business logic. jBPM focuses on executable business processes, which are business processes that&#xD;
    contain enough detail so they can actually be executed on a BPM jBPM engine. Executable business processes bridge the&#xD;
    gap between business users and developers as they are higher-level and use domain-specific concepts that are understood&#xD;
    by business users but can also be executed directly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Business processes need to be supported throughout their entire life cycle: authoring, deployment, process management&#xD;
    and task lists, and dashboards and reporting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The core of jBPM is a light-weight, extensible workflow engine written in pure Java that allows you to execute business&#xD;
    processes using the latest BPMN 2.0 specification. It can run in any Java environment, embedded in your application or&#xD;
    as a service.&lt;br />&#xD;
