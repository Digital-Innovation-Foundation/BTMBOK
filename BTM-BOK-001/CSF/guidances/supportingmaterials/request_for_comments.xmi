    NIST Seeking Input on Updates to NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework&lt;br />&#xD;
    The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology&#xD;
    (NIST), is planning to update the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, NIST Special Publication 800-181. The public&#xD;
    is invited to provide input by January 13, 2020, for consideration in the update.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The list of topics below covers the major areas in which NIST is considering updates. Comments received by the deadline&#xD;
    will be incorporated to the extent practicable. The resulting draft revision to the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce&#xD;
    Framework (NICE Framework), once completed, also will be provided to the public for further review and comment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NIST held a public webinar titled &quot;How You Can Influence an Update to the NICE Framework&quot; to describe the planned&#xD;
    updates and answer questions on December 3, 2019 at 1:00-2:00 p.m. EST. Details and a recording will be made available&#xD;
    at nist.gov/nice/webinars.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The public is encouraged to provide input either by mailing them to NICE Framework Request for Comments, National&#xD;
    Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive, Stop 2000, Gaithersburg, MD 20899; or via email to &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;mailto:niceframework@nist.gov&quot;>niceframework@nist.gov&lt;/a>. Please put “NICE Framework Request for Comments” in&#xD;
    the subject line of the email.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All submissions, including attachments and other supporting materials, will become part of the public record and are&#xD;
    subject to public disclosure. Sensitive personal information, such as account numbers or Social Security numbers, or&#xD;
    names of other individuals, should not be included. Submissions will not be edited to remove any identifying or contact&#xD;
    information. Do not submit confidential business information, or otherwise sensitive or protected information. All&#xD;
    comments received in response will be made available at nist.gov/nice/framework without change or redaction, so&#xD;
    commenters should not include information they do not wish to be posted (e.g., personal or confidential business&#xD;
    information). Comments that contain profanity, vulgarity, threats or other inappropriate language will not be posted or&#xD;
    considered.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Comments will be accepted until January 13, 2020.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Improvements to the NICE Framework&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following topics are intended to help NIST and its partners who are part of the NICE Community to learn about&#xD;
    experiences in applying and using the NICE Framework and explore opportunities for improvement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Describe what components of the NICE Framework have been most useful to you and why.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe what components of the NICE Framework have been least useful to you and why.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Share any key concepts or topics that you believe are missing from the NICE Framework. Please explain what they are and&#xD;
    why they merit special attention.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe how the NICE Framework can be more useful to a variety of audiences (i.e. employers, employees, education and&#xD;
    training providers, learners, small enterprises, etc.).&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe the potential benefits or challenges experienced when aligning the NICE Framework more closely with other&#xD;
    related standards, guidance, or resources (e.g., NIST Framework for Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, NIST Privacy&#xD;
    Framework, other NIST Special Publications, etc.).&lt;br />&#xD;
    Explain if you think the scope of the covered workforce as stated by the NICE Framework needs to be adjusted.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe any improvements that might be made in the current organization of the NICE Framework and its major components&#xD;
    such as Categories, Specialty Areas, Work Roles, Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Tasks.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe how the NICE Framework can best document and describe Knowledge, Skills, Ability, and Task statements as well&#xD;
    as Competency Areas.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Explain whether the NICE Framework indicates which Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities could be considered as foundational&#xD;
    for all workforces that regularly interact with networks, systems, and data in cyberspace.&lt;br />&#xD;
    For each NICE Framework work role, please provide an informative reference that you would like the NICE Framework&#xD;
    Resource Center to reference.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe which components of the NICE Framework you think are best left as static content and would not change until&#xD;
    the next revision and which components could be managed as dynamic content (i.e., more frequent changes or updates to&#xD;
    accommodate new information as it becomes available).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe the value or risk in different organizations, sectors of the economy, or organizations with classified versus&#xD;
    unclassified workforces to develop customized versions of the NICE Framework tailored to their specific&#xD;
    circumstances.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Awareness, Applications, and Uses of the NICE Framework&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Recognizing the critical importance of widespread voluntary usage of the NICE Framework to achieve the goals of&#xD;
    Executive Order 13870 on America’s Cybersecurity Workforce, NIST solicits information about awareness of the NICE&#xD;
    Framework and its application and use by organizations and by individuals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Describe the extent of current awareness of the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework within your organization or&#xD;
    sector or among individuals.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe how you or your organization was introduced to the NICE Framework.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe the greatest challenges and opportunities for increasing awareness and use of the NICE Framework.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Explain how you are currently referencing (i.e., applying or using) the NICE Framework and what plans, if any, you have&#xD;
    for referencing it during the next year.&lt;br />&#xD;
    If you are an employer, describe how your organization uses the NICE Framework to develop position descriptions, guide&#xD;
    skill-based training, facilitate workforce planning, or other uses.&lt;br />&#xD;
    If you are an education or training provider, describe how your organization uses the NICE Framework to develop or&#xD;
    describe education and training content or associated credentials.&lt;br />&#xD;
    If you are an employee, job seeker or learner, describe how you use the NICE Framework for communicating your&#xD;
    competencies or skills to employers, identifying training or professional development needs, or navigating your career&#xD;
    pathway.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe any tools, resources, or publications that exist that reference or would benefit by referencing the NICE&#xD;
    Framework.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Describe any tools, resources, or technical support needed to increase the application and use of the NICE&#xD;
    Framework.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Propose any improvements for the application and use of the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.&#xD;
