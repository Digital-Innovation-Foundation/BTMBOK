    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What are the traditional forms of organizational structure?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What contemporary organizational structures are companies using?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why are companies using team-based organizational structures?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What tools do companies use to establish relationships within their organizations?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How can the degree of centralization/decentralization be altered to make an organization more successful?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do mechanistic and organic organizations differ?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How does the informal organization affect the performance of the company?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What trends are influencing the way businesses organize?&lt;br />&#xD;
    This module focuses on the different types of organizational structure, the reasons an organization might prefer one&#xD;
    structure over another, and how the choice of an organizational structure ultimately can impact that organization’s&#xD;
    success.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In today’s dynamic business environment, organizational structures need to be designed so that the organization can&#xD;
    quickly respond to new competitive threats and changing customer needs. Future success for companies will depend on&#xD;
    their ability to be flexible and respond to the needs of customers. In this chapter, we’ll look first at how companies&#xD;
    build organizational structures by implementing traditional, contemporary, and team-based models. Then, we’ll explore&#xD;
    how managers establish the relationships within the structures they have designed, including determining lines of&#xD;
    communication, authority, and power. Finally, we’ll examine what managers need to consider when designing&#xD;
    organizational structures and the trends that are changing the choices companies make about organizational design.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Elise Eberwein&lt;br />&#xD;
    EVP of People and Communications, American Airlines&lt;br />&#xD;
    As executive vice president of people and communications at American Airlines, Elise Eberwein’s role within the&#xD;
    structure of the organization might not be readily apparent. After all, you might ask, doesn’t corporate communications&#xD;
    typically involve marketing? And what does that have to do with organizational structure? As it turns out, quite a bit&#xD;
    at the world’s largest airline.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When American Airlines and US Airways finally got the U.S. government’s approval to merge in late 2013, it was no&#xD;
    longer business as usual for Eberwein and her colleagues at the “new” airline. Until the merger, which basically&#xD;
    produced the world’s largest airline with more than 6,000 daily flights and 102,900 employees, Eberwein was head of&#xD;
    communications at US Airways—a position she held for nine years after various other jobs in the airline industry.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Communications and aviation are in Eberwein’s DNA. She worked as a flight attendant at TWA before moving on to manage&#xD;
    communications at Denver-based Frontier Airlines. Her next communications experience was at America West, which then&#xD;
    merged with US Airways, where Eberwein served as executive vice president of people, communications, and public affairs&#xD;
    before she took over the chief communications job at American Airlines.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Corporation communications is no longer just about marketing. The importance of an effective communications strategy&#xD;
    cannot be understated in today’s 24/7 business environment. Corporate communication executives have taken on an&#xD;
    expanded role in many organizations, according to a recent survey by the Korn Ferry Institute. Of the senior&#xD;
    communications executives from Fortune 500 companies who responded to the survey, nearly 40 percent said chief&#xD;
    communications officers report directly to the CEO. In addition, more than two-thirds of respondents believe the most&#xD;
    important leadership characteristic for communications professionals is having a strategic mindset that goes beyond&#xD;
    day-to-day communications activities and looks ahead to future possibilities that can be translated into achievable&#xD;
    corporate strategies at all levels of the organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In a company as large as American Airlines, even after the initial two-year integration plan, there are many&#xD;
    departments, unions, and other employees to communicate with on a daily basis, not to mention the millions of customers&#xD;
    they serve every day. For example, American’s social media hub consists of 30 or so team members, divided into three&#xD;
    groups: social customer service, social engagement, and social insights. The customer service group, the largest of the&#xD;
    three, operates around the clock to address customers’ issues, including missed flight connections and lost luggage, as&#xD;
    well as quirky questions like why American airplanes have a specific number of stripes on their tails. Reporting to&#xD;
    Eberwein, the social media group is empowered to reach out to any company department directly to get answers for any&#xD;
    customer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Eberwein believes her role includes working closely with the CEO and other managers across the globe to provide&#xD;
    consistent, detailed information to all of its stakeholders. To accomplish this feat, Eberwein and other senior&#xD;
    managers hold a weekly Monday morning meeting to review the previous week’s operations data, revenue results, and&#xD;
    people engagement activities. Eberwein believes establishing this regular contact with colleagues across the&#xD;
    organization helps reinforce American’s commitment to engagement and transparent communications, which ultimately&#xD;
    shapes the customer’s experience as well as the entire company.&#xD;
