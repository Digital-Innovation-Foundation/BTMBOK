    Making Ethical decisions and Managing a Socially Responsible Business&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What philosophies and concepts shape personal ethical standards?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How can organizations encourage ethical business behavior?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What is corporate social responsibility?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do businesses meet their social responsibilities to various stakeholders?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the trends in ethics and corporate social responsibility?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Every day, managers and business owners make business decisions based on what they believe to be right and wrong.&#xD;
    Through their actions, they demonstrate to their employees what is and is not acceptable behavior and shape the moral&#xD;
    standard of the organization. As you will see in this module, personal and professional ethics are important&#xD;
    cornerstones of an organization and shape its ultimate contributions to society in the form of corporate social&#xD;
    responsibility. First, let’s consider how individual business ethics are formed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Playing with a Purpose at Hasbro&lt;br />&#xD;
    Hasbro is a global play and entertainment company that takes corporate social responsibility (CSR) very seriously.&#xD;
    Founded nearly a century ago in Rhode Island, Hasbro integrates its CSR efforts throughout the organization with the&#xD;
    goal of helping to make the world a better place for children of all ages.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In 2017, the company achieved the number one spot in the “100 Best Corporate Citizens” rankings, published annually by&#xD;
    Corporate Responsibility magazine. Hasbro is no stranger to this achievement; over the past five years, Hasbro has&#xD;
    consistently been in the top five spots on this prestigious list—and that is no accident.&lt;br />&#xD;
    With more than 5,000 employees, Hasbro relies heavily on its strategic brand blueprint to guide its efforts in CSR,&#xD;
    innovation, philanthropy, and product development. With a business portfolio that includes such well-known brands as&#xD;
    Nerf, Play-Doh, Transformers, Monopoly, and The Game of Life, the company focuses its CSR efforts on four key areas:&#xD;
    product safety, environmental sustainability, human rights and ethical sourcing, and community.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    According to the company, product safety is its highest priority. Hasbro uses a five-step quality assurance process&#xD;
    that starts with design and then moves to engineering, manufacturing, and packaging. Another key part of product safety&#xD;
    at Hasbro is incorporating continuous feedback from both consumers and retailers and insisting that these high&#xD;
    standards and quality processes apply to all third-party factories worldwide that manufacture its products.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Hasbro is also committed to finding new ways to reduce its environmental footprint. Over the past several years, the&#xD;
    company has reduced energy consumption, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced water consumption and waste&#xD;
    production in its production facilities. In addition, Hasbro has totally eliminated the use of wire ties in all of its&#xD;
    product packaging, saving more than 34,000 miles of wire ties—more than enough to wrap around the earth’s&#xD;
    circumference.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Human rights and ethical sourcing remains a key ingredient of Hasbro’s CSR success. Treating people fairly is a core&#xD;
    company value, as is working diligently to make great strides in diversity and inclusion at all levels of the&#xD;
    organization. Company personnel work closely with third-party factories to ensure that the human rights of all workers&#xD;
    in the Hasbro global supply chain are recognized and upheld.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Philanthropy, corporate giving, and employee volunteering are key components of the Hasbro community. Through its&#xD;
    various charitable programs, Hasbro made close to $15 million in financial contributions and product donations in 2016,&#xD;
    which reached close to an estimated 4 million children around the globe. Several years ago the company started an&#xD;
    annual Global Day of Joy as a way of engaging its employees worldwide in community service. In a recent year, more than&#xD;
    93 percent of Hasbro’s employees participated in service projects in more than 40 countries.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Hasbro is in the business of storytelling, and its CSR efforts tell the story of an ethical, responsible organization&#xD;
    whose mission is to create the world’s best play experiences. Its ability to be accountable for its actions and to help&#xD;
    make the world a better place one experience at time continues to make it a highly successful company.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
