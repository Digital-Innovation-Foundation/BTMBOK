    The purpose of this activity is to review an&amp;nbsp;Architecture Decision (AD), specifically to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review the context and description;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Examine the stated constraints;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review the rational;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Review the implications;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Evaluate the decisions using one or more specific architectural aspects: performance, reliability,&#xD;
        implementability, modifiability, cost, security, safety;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Approve, reject or require revision of the AD.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>The context is reviewed to ensure it is complete and well-defined. It is also examined to ensured that the AD does not&#xD;
overlap or replace an existing AD (in which case it would be rejected and the originator told to revise the existing AD).</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_m1z4MMUnEdyVgeP6fyp1bg" name="Examine the Constraints " guid="_m1z4MMUnEdyVgeP6fyp1bg">
    <sectionDescription>The constraints are reviewed to ensure they are complete and well-defined. They are also examined to ensure that they are&#xD;
valid and required; they are useful and serve a purpose.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_qDVkIMUnEdyVgeP6fyp1bg" name="Review the Rationale" guid="_qDVkIMUnEdyVgeP6fyp1bg">
    <sectionDescription>The rationale supporting the stated decision is reviewed to ensure it is complete and well-defined. It is also placed into&#xD;
the context of existing ADs to ensure that there is no conflict. The logic is also reviewed.</sectionDescription>

also placed into the context of existing ADs to ensure that there&amp;nbsp;are no conflicts or gaps.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>The decision described in the AD is reviewed to ensure it is complete and well-defined. It is also placed into the context&#xD;
of existing ADs to ensure that there is no conflict. Other aspects may be further examined (e.g. cost) and clarified in&#xD;
support of making a decision on the AD.</sectionDescription>

  <purpose>The purpose of this activity is to review an architectural decision. Documenting important architectural decisions provides&#xD;
a repository of decision that will help guide other architects, managers and implementors in being compliant with&#xD;
enterprise and business domain standards and solutions. They also provide a source of information for re-visiting decisions&#xD;
over time.</purpose>
