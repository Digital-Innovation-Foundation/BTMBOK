  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In information technology, gap analysis is the study of the differences between two different IT architectures, usually&#xD;
    for the purpose of determining how to get from one state to a new state. A &lt;em>gap&lt;/em> is sometimes spoken of as &quot;the&#xD;
    difference between where we are and where we want to be.&quot; Gap analysis is undertaken as a&amp;nbsp;starting point for&#xD;
    figuring out how to&amp;nbsp;bridge that space; how to migrate in a logical and low risk way to the new state. A model&#xD;
    of&amp;nbsp;the target&amp;nbsp;architecture is created, now we need to analyze the model in relation to the current&#xD;
    architecture to aid in the transition from one to the other.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The steps involved in doing a gap analysis are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the scope&amp;nbsp;of the analysis,&amp;nbsp;if not clear from the architecture in question (i.e. the Context and&#xD;
        Scope);&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create an &quot;existing architecture&quot; description if needed;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create an &quot;target architecture&quot; description if needed;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Collect all documentation&amp;nbsp;of the existing environment and the target architecture;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Compare the current environment's Entity, Processes,&amp;nbsp;Location and&amp;nbsp;Roles Models to those identified in the&#xD;
        target;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Find and describe the gaps;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prioritize the gaps that were identified based upon stakeholder priorities, practicalities of migration,&amp;nbsp;and&#xD;
        the state of the current environment.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The output is a prioritized summary of areas that need to be transformed in order to achieve the target architecture.&#xD;
    The areas requiring work have priorities applied based upon stakeholder need for new or changed functionality. These&#xD;
    priorities are adjusted, if needed, based upon the state of health of these components in the current environment. This&#xD;
    assessment is then used as input to the development of the migration plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on the objectives&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;level of the gap analysis (i.e., Business, Logical or Technology level) and&#xD;
    the scope (i.e., Enterprise, Business Line, Business Unit or Project) adjust the focus of this activity to suit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This first step involves a review of the existing architecture, or project documentation of existing assets. The&#xD;
    architectural components, in terms of entities, processes, locations and actors/roles are identified. Similarly the&#xD;
    components at the Logical and / or&amp;nbsp;Technology layers are identified and documentation extracted (i.e.&#xD;
    logical/technical data, logical/technical processes, logical/technical locations and logical/technical roles).&#xD;
    Architectural patterns are also identified (e.g., n-tier or client-server, etc.).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A similar analysis of the target architecture is performed, resulting in a list of components, structures and&#xD;
    patterns&amp;nbsp;to be compared in the next step.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This documentation step involves more than just simply documenting new components or capability. In is essential that&#xD;
    differences in how components perform their tasks is understood, and that differences in processes are identified, or&#xD;
    even minor differences in entity (data) definitions. These differences can be categorized into one of the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>New&lt;/strong> - new data, functions, process or roles&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Change&lt;/strong> - a change in the data, functions, process or roles&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Delete&lt;/strong> - a deleted data, function, process or role&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Relationships between these components (i.e., data, function, process&amp;nbsp;and role) are also identified and documented&#xD;
    in order to understand dependencies that need to be address during the migration.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_Bl3WYNM2EdyTfZVjf0InKw" name="Prioritize Gaps" guid="_Bl3WYNM2EdyTfZVjf0InKw">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The complete picture is then analyzed, with the aid of stakeholders, in order to refine the understanding of these&#xD;
    differences and to define priorities. These priorities are based upon two aspects:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Needs&lt;/strong> - it is the new or updated functionality is a priority for the business;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>State of Existing&lt;/strong> - the state, in terms of maintainability and reliability and cost of existing&#xD;
        components.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These two aspects of each gap&amp;nbsp;are evaluated and a relative priority assigned to the gap. A three level priority&#xD;
    (i.e., High, Medium, Low) scheme is recommended.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A complementary analysis needs to be performed as well, namely an analysis based upon component dependencies and&#xD;
    implementation and migration considerations. This analysis, along with an understanding of the defined priorities, is&#xD;
    in essence results in the information at the core of a migration plan—thus the Gap Analysis documentation produced&#xD;
    here&amp;nbsp;is a key input into the development of a Migration Plan.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Gap analysis consists of comparing the present state and&amp;nbsp;the desired end or 'target' state and deriving and&#xD;
    describing the gap between them. This 'gap' description is then used, along with other analysis, to derive a migration&#xD;
    plan—the plan from migrating from the current state to the target state through a series of steps, which in the IT&#xD;
    architecture context means through a series of projects and project releases. The purpose of gap analysis is to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul class=&quot;noindent&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify the differences between the architectural components and patterns of existing solutions and those of the&#xD;
        target architecture;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Document these differences;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prioritize these differences as an aid to the next steps.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></purpose>
