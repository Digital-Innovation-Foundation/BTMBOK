&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Research Writers produce Research Reports that address information needs of customers based upon completed research.&#xD;
    The Report Writers reviews the research information provided and determines if: enough information is there to produce&#xD;
    a report, insufficient information&amp;nbsp;was provided, or the report task is not required (for various reasons).&#xD;
    If&amp;nbsp; there is insufficient information available at this time, the Report Task is re-queued for later action, or if&#xD;
    determined that there is no longer any need for this report task, the Report Task is deleted.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the analysis of the source information results in the discovery of information that addresses a Customer Information&#xD;
    Need a new Report is created&amp;nbsp;from this information.&amp;nbsp;Once a Report has been finalized, reviewed it is released&#xD;
    for approval (and publication). Source Information is at times also included in the Report if desired along with&#xD;
    references to this Source Information. Cross references are added into the Source Info Store pointing to the Report&#xD;
    thus indicating the information that the Report was based upon. Similarly, the Report contains information on the&#xD;
    author and reviewers.&#xD;
