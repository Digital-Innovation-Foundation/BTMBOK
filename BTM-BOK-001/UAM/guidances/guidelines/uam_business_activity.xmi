    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Unified Architecture Method (UAM) uses the concepts and terminology as defined by the OMG's Business Process&#xD;
    Modeling Notation definition to describe business activities, processes and tasks. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/whitepapers/uam_bpmn_standards_84B155CD.html&quot; guid=&quot;_JqlCMOAEEdynr9jlfK-aMA&quot;>Whitepaper:&#xD;
    BPMN - the standard&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/whitepapers/uam_bpmn_intro_tutorial_426154F6.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_gYTbgN2MEdyVUKFKTmaZUA&quot;>Whitepaper: BPMN - an Introductory Tutorial&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    BPMN defines business activities as work to be performed as part of a business process. Activities in turn represent&#xD;
    either a Task (an atomic activity) or a Sub-Process (a compound activity).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The processes in a business are therefore defined as a number of connected different business activities, each of which&#xD;
    represents a specific task or sub-process in the business. An activity defines what happens within the business when an&#xD;
    event starts it up; it describes a sequence of actions (Tasks and Sub-Processes) that produces a valuable result&#xD;
    for&amp;nbsp;the business.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the very simple example below&amp;nbsp;there are&amp;nbsp;a number of&amp;nbsp;business&#xD;
    activities defined that support an airline and passengers checking in to a flight with luggage.:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Example of Business Activities and associated Actors&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Figure 1 - A passenger can travel individually or with a group. When traveling with a group, a passenger is&#xD;
    accompanied by a tour guide.&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    From an individual actor's perspective, a business activity defines the complete workflow that produces the desired&#xD;
    results. This is similar to what is generally called a &quot;business process&quot;, but &quot;a business activity&quot; in the context of&#xD;
    the UAM (and BPMN)&amp;nbsp;has a much more precise definition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The definition of the business activity concept, as do all of the models defined within the UAM,&amp;nbsp;differentiates&#xD;
    between &lt;em>instances&lt;/em> and &lt;em>classes&lt;/em>. This, and other important concepts, which aid in understanding and&#xD;
    identifying business activities are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Activity&lt;/strong> - to make the business activity model more comprehensible, similar processes are&#xD;
        grouped together&amp;nbsp;into a business activity. In reality, there are a great number of possible processes for any&#xD;
        given business activity, many of them very similar with the main differences being conditional aspects of the&#xD;
        workflow (for example, the type of product that the customer would like to purchase). Thus a business activity&#xD;
        (class) will define decision points and alternative flows; which path is taken will depend on the state of the&#xD;
        business, business events,&amp;nbsp;and input from the business actor.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Actors and Roles&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;- The actor is probably the real key to finding the correct business&#xD;
        activities. Starting with individual actors — or really &lt;em>instances&lt;/em> of actors — helps&amp;nbsp;in finding&#xD;
        business activities. At the enterprise level, the actors and the activities are going to be, initially, covering a&#xD;
        large portion of the business through abstraction. This layering is the only way to deal with this complexity. See:&#xD;
        &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_user-actor-role_8210ACA7.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_r8jW8OPQEdy7f9KmjDtwsA&quot;>Guideline: Users, Actors and Roles&lt;/a>. &lt;strong>&lt;em>Note&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>: Only&#xD;
        &lt;em>actors&lt;/em> are defined at the Business level, roles imply that the activity is interactive; a decision&#xD;
        that&amp;nbsp;is made only at the Logical level.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>A result of observable value&lt;/strong> - helps in determining the correct extent of a business activity,&#xD;
        which should be neither too small nor too big (but this is hard to avoid at the enterprise level). Requiring that&#xD;
        the business activity give a result of observable value, that is, both perceived and measurable, helps&amp;nbsp;in&#xD;
        finding a complete flow, and in avoiding business activities that are too small (i.e. a single Task is likely not a&#xD;
        complete business activity).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>In a business&lt;/strong> - The words &quot;in a business&quot;, means both that the business provides the business&#xD;
        activity to the actor, and that the business&amp;nbsp;activity only covers what is actually done within the business.&#xD;
        Supporting work done elsewhere is not included.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Action&lt;/strong> - The actions are invoked either on request from an actor to the business, or through some&#xD;
        other business event. Actions include internal tasks and decisions, as well as requests to either the invoked actor&#xD;
        or other actors.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business activities specify the interactions between the subject business and its business actors, &lt;em>and the effect&#xD;
    that they have on the business&lt;/em> — the performance of a business activity may change the state of the business (and&#xD;
    thus may change the way the business responds to future events or interactions), and the business activities must&#xD;
    specify and capture these state changes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A services view of the business is also possible, since what the business directly and explicitly provides to its&#xD;
    environment are &lt;em>services&lt;/em>, and the interaction between the Business Actor and the business, as described in the&#xD;
    Business Activity, will take place through the invocation of one or more of those services. Note that for new business&#xD;
    development (the creation of a new business or business line&amp;nbsp;for example), or when changing the&#xD;
    business,&amp;nbsp;Business Activities are one way of identifying services that the business provides. It is easy enough to&#xD;
    equate Business Activities to Business Services&amp;nbsp;in the business view, since at this level there should be no&#xD;
    notion of how these activities or services will be implemented, in other words, they are just labels on the (possible&#xD;
    collection of) activities that the system provides/uses.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The collected set of Business Activities constitutes all the possible ways of accessing/using the business, and all the&#xD;
    possible actions (events) and actors that the business deals with. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_business_process_model_D051CAFD.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_HHxlUOSFEdy7f9KmjDtwsA&quot;>Guideline: Business Process Model&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;XE_Business_Activity__extent_of&quot; name=&quot;XE_Business_Activity__extent_of&quot;>Extent of Business&amp;nbsp;Activities&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is sometimes hard to decide if a service is one, or several business activities. Apply the definition of a business&#xD;
    activity to the airport check-in process. A passenger hands his ticket and baggage to the check-in agent, who finds a&#xD;
    seat for the passenger, prints a boarding pass and starts baggage-handling. If the passenger has normal baggage, the&#xD;
    check-in agent prints baggage tag and customer claim check, and terminates the business activity by applying the tag to&#xD;
    the baggage, and giving the customer claim check, together with the boarding pass, to the passenger. If the baggage is&#xD;
    oversize so that it cannot be transported normally, the passenger must take it to a special baggage counter.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Do you need one &quot;business activity&quot; at the check-in counter, another at the special baggage counter? Similarly, what if&#xD;
    a passenger checks-in at a self-service kiosk, is this a different &quot;business activity&quot;? Or are all of these part&#xD;
    of&amp;nbsp;a single business activity? These transactions involve several&amp;nbsp;slightly different types of actions. But&#xD;
    the question is, will any of them be of value to a passenger carrying special baggage if he does not do the other (i.e.&#xD;
    self-serve check-in without baggage handling)? Not really, it is only a complete procedure (from&amp;nbsp;check-in until he&#xD;
    is ready to board)&amp;nbsp;that has value and&amp;nbsp;makes sense to the passenger. Thus, the complete procedure involving&#xD;
    the self-serve kiosk and possibly&amp;nbsp;(zero to) two different baggage counters is&amp;nbsp;all part of the&#xD;
    same&amp;nbsp;business activity (that may be decomposed into more detailed activities).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to this &quot;cohesive and complete&quot; criteria, it is practical to keep descriptions of closely related services&#xD;
    together, so that you can review them at the same time, modify them together, test them together, write manuals for&#xD;
    them, and in general manage them as a unit. Note also that two independent business activities can have similar&#xD;
    beginnings.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    In an insurance company, the business activities &lt;em>Handle Claim&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Handle Request&lt;/em> both start when&#xD;
    someone (an actor) makes contact with a claim handler. The claim handler and the actor exchange some information to&#xD;
    make it clear whether the actor is filing a claim or requesting some information. Then, and only then, is it possible&#xD;
    to decide which business activity is underway. Although the two business activities have similar beginnings, they are&#xD;
    not connected.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Name&quot; name=&quot;Name&quot;>Name&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The name of the business activity should express what happens when an instance of the business activity is performed.&#xD;
    The form of the name should therefore be active, typically described by the gerund form of the verb&#xD;
    (&lt;em>Checking-in&lt;/em>) or a verb and a noun together (&lt;em>Check-in Individual&lt;/em>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The names can either describe the tasks in the business activity, for instance &lt;em>placing an order&lt;/em>. Although a&#xD;
    business activity describes what happens within the business, it is often most natural (and recommended) &amp;nbsp;to name&#xD;
    the business activity from its primary actor's point of view.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Goals&quot; name=&quot;Goals&quot;>Goals&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The goal of a business activity should be specified from at least two perspectives:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For the business actors the business process interacts with, specify the value those business actors expect from&#xD;
        the business (expected result).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        From the perspective of the organization performing the business processes, define what the objectives are of&#xD;
        having this business process in place and what you hope to achieve by performing it (business outcomes).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Performance Goals&quot; name=&quot;Performance Goals&quot;>Performance Goals&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some common metrics categories to note when describing the activity are:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Time&lt;/strong> - an approximation of the time it should take to execute the activity, or part of the&#xD;
        activity.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Cost&lt;/strong> - an approximation of the cost of executing the activity, or part of the activity.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Quality&lt;/strong> - for example, &quot;no more than 2% of products should be defective when they come off the&#xD;
        production line&quot;.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A major challenge is to understand what scenarios (business activity instances) are relevant to measure. Criteria to&#xD;
    use are frequency of the scenario, or business relevance of the scenario. If you can determine that a particular part&#xD;
    of the workflow has importance, you may save yourself some effort by only measuring the cost or time of that&#xD;
    subflow.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Workflow - Structure&quot; name=&quot;Workflow - Structure&quot;>Workflow&amp;nbsp;Structure&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most business activities may be thought of as one or more sub-processes, which together yield the total workflow.&#xD;
    Sometimes several business activities in the business have common sub-processes or tasks, or the same sub-process (or&#xD;
    task)&amp;nbsp;appears in different parts of one business activity. If this common behavior has any substantial volume, it&#xD;
    should be performed by the same business actors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a subflow is substantial, common to several business activities, and also forms an independent and naturally&#xD;
    delimited part, the model might be clearer if this behavior is partitioned out to a separate business activity (i.e. a&#xD;
    BPMN Call Activity). This new business activity is then included in the business activity using normal BPMN workflow&#xD;
    concepts and structures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    At the airport check-in counter, the two business activities, &lt;em>Check-in Individual&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Check-in Group&lt;/em>&#xD;
    both use the same procedure to handle an individual passenger's baggage. Because the subflow is independent of the&#xD;
    ticket handling, and is logically connected, it is modeled separately in the business activity as &lt;em>Handle&#xD;
    Baggage&lt;/em> . See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_diagrams_in_business_pers_F47177D2.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_aVWS0OSYEdy7f9KmjDtwsA&quot;>Guideline: Business Perspective Views&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Characteristics of a Good Business Activity&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Its name and brief description are clear and easy to understand, even to people outside the IT architecture&#xD;
            team.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Each business activity is complete from an outside (actor's) perspective. For example, the business activity&#xD;
            &lt;em>Handle Claim&lt;/em> in an insurance company starts when a customer files a claim. The &lt;em>Handle Claim&lt;/em>&#xD;
            business activity is not complete unless it includes a notification about the decision from the insurance&#xD;
            company to the customer and (if appropriate) a compensatory payment.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Each business activity normally is involved with at least one actor, especially high-level activities defined&#xD;
            at the Enterprise Architecture level. Business activities are often (but not always) initiated by actors,&#xD;
            interact with actors to perform the tasks, and deliver results.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It is possible for a supporting activity or &lt;em>call&lt;/em> activity not to interact with an actor. This is true&#xD;
            if a business activity is initiated by an internal event and does not have to interact with an actor to perform&#xD;
            its tasks (i.e. it is a &lt;em>service&lt;/em> activity).&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Characteristics of a Good Process Description&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It must be clear and easy to understand, even for people outside the business modeling team.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It describes the workflow, not just the purpose of the business activity.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It describes only those tasks that are inside the business.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It describes all possible tasks in the business activity. For example, what happens if a condition is met, as&#xD;
            well as what happens if it is not.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It does not mention roles who do not communicate with it. If it did mention other roles, it would make the&#xD;
            description difficult to understand and maintain.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It describes only those tasks that belong to it, not what is going on in other business activities that work&#xD;
            parallel to it.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It does not mention other business activities with which it does not have relationships. If the business&#xD;
            activity requires that some results exist in the business before it can start, this should be described as a&#xD;
            precondition. The precondition should not have any references to the business activity in which the result was&#xD;
            created.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It indicates if the order of any tasks described for the business activity is not fixed.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It is structured so that it is easy to read and understand.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            The description clearly describes the start and end of the workflow.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Each extend-relationship is described clearly so that it is obvious how and when to insert the business&#xD;
            activity.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Characteristics of a Good Abstract Business&amp;nbsp;Activity&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It is substantial. Remember, a concrete business activity must be easy to read, together with its abstract&#xD;
            business activity. Therefore, an abstract business activity should not be too small. If an abstract business&#xD;
            activity is not substantial, it should be eliminated and its tasks should be described in the affected concrete&#xD;
            business activity.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It contains logically related tasks.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            It exists for a specific reason. An abstract business activity should contain any of three kinds of tasks:&#xD;
            those that are common across several business activities; those that are optional; or those that are important&#xD;
            enough that you want to emphasize them in the model.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br class=&quot;example&quot; />&#xD;
