  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architecture summary defines the core elements within the standard aspects of the IT architecture, at the Technical&#xD;
    level&amp;nbsp; (since an existing architecture is being described):&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical Entities - capture a summary of the entities involved along with relationships;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical Processes -&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;capture a summary of the activities involved and the complete process if possible.&#xD;
        Focus on good definitions for the activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical Locations - define the locations where the system operates;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical Roles - define all actors and roles, and if possible the relationships to user and between them.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Optionally capture information on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical Rules - capture the main business rules involved in the system;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical Events - capture the main business events that drive or modify the processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As much detail should be gleaned from existing system documentation as possible and captured in this manner. The next&#xD;
    step will be to define the IT architecture in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/workproducts/uam_perspective_simple_log_1BB8F6F2.html&quot; guid=&quot;_nOvbEMOyEdyILM4NThxMFg&quot;>Simple&#xD;
    Logical Perspective&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This analysis is very similar to &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/tasks/uam_define_system_scope_D6C3E23D.html&quot; guid=&quot;_8vSJQMLfEdy4DtCs1YI90Q&quot;>Task: Define System&#xD;
    Scope &amp;amp; Context&lt;/a> (defining the system Scope) but more detail is captured so that the Simple IT&amp;nbsp;architecture&#xD;
    can be defined.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Defining Actors&quot; name=&quot;Defining Actors&quot;>Defining Actors&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Try to identify who or what interacts with the system. Start initially with actual people who interact with the system;&#xD;
    focus on the concrete. As actors are identified, try to identify the activities that each one interacts with—this is&#xD;
    usually a good starting point for naming the actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Write and agree to a short description for each actor; usually a few bullet-points capturing the activities they&#xD;
    interact with.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When defining actors, do not forget about external interactions with the system. Also, don't forget that an Actor may&#xD;
    also represent an automated system. Find the 'human' actors first, then consider the more esoteric.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The structure or relationships between actors is not important at this point—focus on their relationships with the&#xD;
    system and the capturing of the business activities that the actors interact with. Capture, name and define these&#xD;
    activities as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Define Use Cases&quot; name=&quot;Define Use Cases&quot;>Define Activities, Entities and Locations&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Start to identify (in the context of IT architecture) activities. Focus on concrete activities (avoid discussions about&#xD;
    structuring or reuse of activities for the moment) as described by the users. Draw a square for&#xD;
    the&amp;nbsp;activity&amp;nbsp;and write in the name for each defined activity. Use arrows to the associated actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have the participants describe what the business is supposed to do, in context of the system under study. Ask a lot of&#xD;
    questions about the business, its activities and entities. When the participants provide you with explanations many&#xD;
    business aspects will be defined: entities, processes/activities, locations and actors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some people can understand the concept of business activities right away, and some people cannot. A more physical view&#xD;
    of the activity is helpful (i.e. the current situation).&amp;nbsp;For example, describe a number of specific clients and&#xD;
    their interactions with the system&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;a number of&amp;nbsp;specific business departments&amp;nbsp;and their special&#xD;
    tasks defined.&amp;nbsp;This more concrete view will help to make the business functions&amp;nbsp;extend from&amp;nbsp;one&amp;nbsp;end&#xD;
    of the business to the other, and may point at a number of different business (activity) states. Ask questions about&#xD;
    these states, and some more business functions&amp;nbsp;will appear. Optionally explore what will happen when different&#xD;
    interactions or functions break—this can help you identify alternative flows in the business functions&amp;nbsp;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A diagram describing the processes may be useful. The diagram may describe how a business entity is moved from one&#xD;
    person to another and what they are supposed to do with it.&amp;nbsp;This diagram may also get very physical, specific&#xD;
    physical office or departments may be included if helpful.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Allow the activities to have long names. A recently identified activity may have a name as long as a sentence—this will&#xD;
    be a good start on the brief description of the activity; the name will be shortened later on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There will always be a number of business activities that appear to have parts in common. This is acceptable for now;&#xD;
    do not attempt to structure activities, since we don't know enough about the business activities. Wait until after the&#xD;
    the complete workflow has been defined and properly modeled (i.e. during an architectural review later on).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The definitions are complete when the group agrees that all the actors, processes and activities defined cover the&#xD;
    functionality of the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Write Brief Description for each Use Case&quot; name=&quot;Write Brief Description for each Use Case&quot;>Describe&#xD;
    Each&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a>Activity&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work with the activities one by one, and create a graphical representation.&amp;nbsp;Ask the group to help you write a&#xD;
    brief description of the activity. It should be about 1 to 3 sentences. Sometimes it is useful to draw the Actor&#xD;
    associated with the activity, the same may be done with entities, but do not clutter the diagram, which may confuse&#xD;
    participants. Leave lots of room for the next step (activity detail).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Example graphical description of the business activity&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/Arch_Diagrams-Activity_Description.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Do not be surprised if&amp;nbsp;you discover that there are some things that everybody thought were clear that are not&#xD;
    actually clear at all. Also, note any non-functional and other requirements or constraints that the business experts&#xD;
    mention.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    New activities may be added as the discussion proceeds, and perhaps some will disappear. Put these business activity&#xD;
    descriptions on the walls.&amp;nbsp;If you can't solve questions immediately, write them down on a self-stick note and&#xD;
    place them at the appropriate business activity description. Use one color for questions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When all activities are described and posted it is time for the next step: detailing each activity. It is often wise to&#xD;
    take some time discuss if all the activities are indeed found.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Step-by-Step Description of the Flow of Events for each Use Case&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;Step-by-Step Description of the Flow of Events for each Use Case&quot;>Detail Each Activity&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The way to start describe the activity detail is to structure the descriptions first, using input from the business&#xD;
    stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define the activities one by one. Write down the process steps in order. Don't try figure out how things will look in&#xD;
    technical terms (i.e. code, loops, for-while statements, etc.)—just define the basic flow of the activity and ignore&#xD;
    alternative flows and exceptions. Enumerate the steps 1, 2, 3, 4, to help the group understand the required level of&#xD;
    detail. Typically&amp;nbsp;5 to10 steps in the basic flow should suffice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once you've agreed on the steps in the basic flow of events, walk through it and identify exceptions and how they are&#xD;
    dealt with. Enumerate the alternative flows A1, A2, A3, A4,&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Activity detail descriptions&quot; src=&quot;./resources/Arch_Diagrams-Activity_Detail.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During this discussion a lot of issues will be raised, many of which will not be solved until the &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/workproducts/uam_perspective_simple_log_1BB8F6F2.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_nOvbEMOyEdyILM4NThxMFg&quot;>Artifact: Simple Logical Perspective&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;is completed.&amp;nbsp;Write down all issues,&#xD;
    together with any assumptions you need to make along the way.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What you have on each easel chart now should be sufficient to be able to detail a first draft&amp;nbsp;model of the Simple&#xD;
    Roles Model , Simple Process Model, Simple Entities&amp;nbsp;Model and Simple Locations Model. Note that some Actors (e.g.&#xD;
    Customers) are captured in the model in two ways:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Actors&lt;/strong> - as Actors, since they interact with the system;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Entities&lt;/strong> - as&amp;nbsp;entities, since they are objects 'consumed' and&amp;nbsp;'produced' by&#xD;
        business&amp;nbsp;activities.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Capture Supplementary Specifications&quot; name=&quot;Capture Supplementary Specifications&quot;>Capture Non-functional&#xD;
    Requirements&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During this study, there will be several requirements on the system that you may not be able to readily capture in an&#xD;
    activity or otherwise. Typically, these statements have to do with general functionality, usability, reliability,&#xD;
    performance, and supportability of the system. Keep a separate chart where these are noted.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Discuss which user needs or requirements are associated with defined activities and record these on the charts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Associate requirements with processes&quot; src=&quot;./resources/Arch_Diagrams-Activity_Reqmnts.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Finally, explore all of the locations where the activity, or even a portion of it, is deployed.&amp;nbsp;Enumerate the&#xD;
    locations L1, L2, L3, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Activities, steps, requirements and locations&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/Arch_Diagrams-Activity_Locations.png&quot; />&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Spend a few moments to review the activities: are there activities with no requirements? Why? Is this activity not&#xD;
    required? Or was this functionality forgotten by the person who wrote the requirement specification? This situation has&#xD;
    to be resolved, but examine the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/workproducts/uam_in_project-reqmt_8CF40484.html&quot; guid=&quot;_1R2GQEKgEeShYIpiBstbOQ&quot;>Artifact: Project&#xD;
    Charter&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;or other inputs provided for the creation of the Summary to see if it indeed is define there. Is the&#xD;
    customer aware that he needs this functionality? Is he willing to pay for it?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Final Review&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ask if there is anything missing;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Present the results in your own words—the business / system experts will correct any errors or omissions;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Leave the collation and analysis until after the workshop—just gather all the information that you can.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Gathering this information in preparation for defining the first draft&amp;nbsp;Simple Models&amp;nbsp;takes between&amp;nbsp;3 to&#xD;
    6 days (or even more) depending upon the scope of the system.&#xD;
