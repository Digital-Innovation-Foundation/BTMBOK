# BTM Courseware - Invitation

**Proposal**

Teaching faculty in higher education requires access to a new form of textbook to introduce managers to digital leadership, with different focus at undergrad and grad levels.

We invite the academic and practitioner community to work on a new free and open-access BTM courseware: 

- Book (12 chapters)
- Cases (3 per chapter, 2 small and 1 large)
- Appendices (overviews: technologies, BTM, BTM careers)
- Readings (links to resources)
- Presentations (powerpoints)
- Tutorials (videos)

This suite of free assets will be published as complements to the BTMBOK, which has a different audience, being primarily an open index of BTM competencies, not a pedagogical tool, but valuable free contents to be reused-refactored into courseware.

We do not aim to replicate existing excellent open-access courseware, such as the one developed by David Bourgeois and his team, adopted by 70+ universities worldwide.

However, the proposal is to take a different orientation altogether, mostly as an experimental process.

**Philosophy**

The overall pedagogical philosophy could follow a more "pragmatic" approach to introducing digital leadership to non-IS/IT managers.

Existing textbooks and intro courses tend to present Information Systems primarily as "theory toward practice", with cases aligned to serve "illustrations of theory" as opposed to "building from practice".

This "top-down" approach is typical of all Administrative Sciences functional disciplines, and IS remains framed in this functional perspective.

Yet, as the 2000-era moto says, "all business is e-business", and as such "all enterprise is digital", hence the need to broaden, from IT to BTM, and then from BTM to whole-business.

Some initial thoughts were exposed in this 2022 AMCIS paper on "Digital-as-Practice", building upon and integrating other "as-practice" perspectives, e.g., Strategy, Project, Leadership, etc.

**Outline**

One key issue is the textbook "crescendo" of 12 chapters, which need to be linear, and present BTM from a pragmatic perspective.
