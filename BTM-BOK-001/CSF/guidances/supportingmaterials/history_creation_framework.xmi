    Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Framework development process initiated with Executive Order 13636, which was released on February 12, 2013.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    The Executive Order introduced efforts on the sharing of cybersecurity threat information, and on building a set of&#xD;
    current and successful approaches, a framework, for reducing risks to critical infrastructure. Through this Executive&#xD;
    Order, NIST was tasked with the development of a &quot;Cybersecurity Framework&quot;&lt;br />&#xD;
    “It is the policy of the United States to enhance the security and resilience of the Nation’s critical infrastructure&#xD;
    and to maintain a cyber environment that encourages efficiency, innovation, and economic prosperity while promoting&#xD;
    safety, security, business confidentiality, privacy, and civil liberties&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Executive Order established the following requirements for the Framework that NIST used as design criteria:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify security standards and guidelines applicable across sectors of critical infrastructure&lt;br />&#xD;
    Provide a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective approach&lt;br />&#xD;
    Help owners and operators of critical infrastructure identify, assess, and manage cyber risk&lt;br />&#xD;
    Enable technical innovation and account for organizational differences&lt;br />&#xD;
    Provide guidance that is technology neutral and enables critical infrastructure sectors to benefit from a competitive&#xD;
    market for products and services&lt;br />&#xD;
    Include guidance for measuring the performance of implementing the Cybersecurity Framework&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identify areas for improvement that should be addressed through future collaboration with particular sectors and&#xD;
    standards-developing organizations&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why NIST?&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NIST was selected for the task of developing the Framework because they are a non-regulatory federal agency that acts&#xD;
    as an unbiased source of scientific data and practices, including cybersecurity practices. NIST’s mission is to promote&#xD;
    U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness.&amp;nbsp; NIST has a long history of successfully addressing critical&#xD;
    national issues through partnerships with industry, academia, and other government agencies.&amp;nbsp; This kind of&#xD;
    collaboration would be critical for the Framework to be successful.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Creating the Framework&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Framework was, and continues to be, developed and promoted through ongoing engagement with, and input from,&#xD;
    stakeholders in government, industry, and academia. To develop the Framework, over the course of a year, NIST used a&#xD;
    Request for Information (RFI) and Request for Comment (RFC), as well as extensive outreach and five workshops around&#xD;
    the country to: (i) identify existing cybersecurity standards, guidelines, frameworks, and best practices that were&#xD;
    applicable to increase the security of critical infrastructure sectors and other interested entities; (ii) specify&#xD;
    high-priority gaps for which new or revised standards were needed; and (iii) collaboratively develop action plans by&#xD;
    which these gaps could be addressed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Framework Creation Events &amp;amp; Timeline&lt;br />&#xD;
    Below are a some of the major milestones in the public-private partnership which led to the creation of the Framework.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Executive Order 13636 - Feb 12, 2013&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Executive Order 13636 was signed by President Obama on February 12, 2013. As described above, the Executive Order&#xD;
    outlined several objectives for establishing a cybersecurity framework to help protect the nations critical&#xD;
    infrastructure. The Executive Order also requested the framework be developed with support from industry and academia&#xD;
    and published within one-year of the Executive Order's signing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    RFI - Developing a Framework to Improve Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity&amp;nbsp; - February 26, 2013&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Shortly after the release of Executive Order 13636, NIST released the first in a series of Requests for Information&#xD;
    (RFIs) on February 26, 2013. The primary objectives for the initial RFI was to collect lessons learned from industry by&#xD;
    understanding which standards were being used, and how effective these standards were in improving cybersecurity across&#xD;
    industries. During the comment period ending on April 8, 2013, NIST received over 270 responses to the RFI and analyzed&#xD;
    them to develop the agenda for the 2nd Cybersecurity Framework workshop.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    1st Cybersecurity Framework Workshop&amp;nbsp; - April 3, 2013&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The First Framework Workshop was held as an online-only broadcast from the Department of Commerce in Washington&#xD;
    D.C.&amp;nbsp; The purpose of this workshop was primarily to gather industry interest, raise awareness of the Framework&#xD;
    endeavor, and to provide insight into the collaborative Framework development process that was just getting&#xD;
    started.&amp;nbsp; At this Workshop, the primary topics included discussions about the Executive Order 13636, the goals in&#xD;
    the development of the Framework, and to reaffirm the collaborative process that would be used to create the&#xD;
    Framework.&amp;nbsp; At this event, NIST announced a series of collaborative, in-person, workshops all across the country.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    2nd Cybersecurity Framework Workshop&amp;nbsp; - May 29-31, 2013&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This workshop, along with the following workshops that led up to the Framework's release, were strategically held in&#xD;
    locations around the US to help promote attendance by as many participants across as many critical infrastructure&#xD;
    sectors as possible. Each of these workshops were also webcast live, and recorded, to allow remote attendees to view&#xD;
    and participate.&amp;nbsp; This workshop was held at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg, PA. The agenda for the&#xD;
    workshop was developed based on the analysis of the first RFI, with the goal to further refine and clarify information&#xD;
    received. The workshop was held across three days and included several simultaneous tracks on specific topics uncovered&#xD;
    during the RFI to facilitate the data collection activities. NIST facilitated the workshops to encourage dialogue and&#xD;
    debate across a wide range of security topics. Through these discussions, NIST was able to gain a clearer understanding&#xD;
    from industry of what was working well, where additional guidance was needed, and which topics should be avoided in the&#xD;
    Framework. Following the workshops, NIST analyzed the information presented and developed summary papers describing&#xD;
    their take-away from the workshops. The summaries were then shared back with industry and used to create the&#xD;
    Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework draft.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework Released&amp;nbsp; - July 1, 2013&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework captured the information received from the initial RFI and the previous&#xD;
    workshop. It presented the information in a standardized format to allow NIST to clearly articulate to industry how&#xD;
    they were capturing their thoughts and comments. NIST released the preliminary draft on July 1, 2013 in preparation for&#xD;
    the third workshop held on July 10 -12, 2013.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    3rd Cybersecurity Framework Workshop&amp;nbsp; - July 10-12, 2013&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Third Framework Workshop was held at the University of California in San Diego, CA on July 10-12, 2013. At this&#xD;
    workshop, the agenda heavily focused on working sessions to discuss the Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework and what&#xD;
    should be included moving forward.&amp;nbsp; NIST received a great deal of input on what participants wanted to see&#xD;
    included in the Categories and Subcategories of the Framework, how levels of Framework implementation should be&#xD;
    determined, and how Informative References should be included in the Core. NIST analyzed this information, shared the&#xD;
    key take-aways with participants, and used it to create the next iteration of the Draft Framework.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Discussion Draft of Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework Released&amp;nbsp; - August 28, 2013&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NIST greatly expanded upon the material that was included in the 1st Preliminary Framework Draft by folding in the&#xD;
    comments and information gathered in the previous workshop.&amp;nbsp; The Draft Framework grew from being an annotated&#xD;
    outline, to being a fully drafted document. NIST included a 5-step process for implementation and fleshed out the&#xD;
    Framework core with a number of Categories, Subcategories, and Informative References.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    4th Cybersecurity Framework Workshop - September 11-13, 2013&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Fourth Workshop was held at the University of Texas at Dallas in Richardson, TX on September 11-13, 2013.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    Before this workshop, participants were asked to have reviewed the latest draft of the Framework, as it was the focus&#xD;
    of the agenda.&amp;nbsp; Again, this workshop heavily concentrated on working sessions that split the participants into&#xD;
    small groups to discuss their feedback about the Discussion Draft of the Framework.&amp;nbsp; NIST received feedback that&#xD;
    included the need for additional clarification around the Framework Core, Tier, and Profile integration, expressing the&#xD;
    Core in terms of outcomes, and a variety of other areas of the Draft Framework that needed improvements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    RFC - Comments on the Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework&amp;nbsp; - October 29, 2013&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    On October 29, 2013 NIST released an RFC seeking comments on the latest version of the Preliminary Framework Draft.&#xD;
    Over the 45-day comment period, ending on December 13, 2013, NIST received over 200 comments.&amp;nbsp; These comments,&#xD;
    along with those received during the 5th Framework Workshop, heavily influenced the version 1.0 Framework publication.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    5th Cybersecurity Framework Workshop&amp;nbsp; - November 14-15, 2013&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Fifth Workshop was held at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC on November 14-15, 2013. During this&#xD;
    Workshop, specific breakout sessions were held for small and medium business, how the Framework could be used, and a&#xD;
    voluntary critical infrastructure cybersecurity program. These breakout sessions, as well as others held during the&#xD;
    workshop, allowed participants to openly discuss the preliminary draft and provide recommendations for enhancements&#xD;
    that should be considered before NIST published the Framework. As with all preceding workshops, NIST summarized the key&#xD;
    points collected during the workshop as closing remarks to the workshop and then took the information collected during&#xD;
    the workshop, along with comments received through the RFC, to finalize version 1.0 of the Framework.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Framework 1.0 Publication - February 12, 2014&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One year after the release of Executive Order 13636, on February 12, 2014, NIST released version 1.0 of the Framework&#xD;
    for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. The Framework was released as voluntary guidance, based on&#xD;
    existing standards, guidelines, and practices, for critical infrastructure organizations to better manage and reduce&#xD;
    cybersecurity risk. The Framework captured key points received from the RFIs and workshops held during its&#xD;
    collaborative development process. The Framework incorporates comments from over 3,000 workshop attendees and 15,000&#xD;
    comments received during its development. While the release of Framework v1.0 was a significant milestone, NIST did not&#xD;
    stop coordinating with industry following its release. NIST, to this day, continues community outreach activities as&#xD;
    well as active dialogue with industry though industry workshops and continued Framework workshops.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
