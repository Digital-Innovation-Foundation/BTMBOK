  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Roles viewpoint defines the roles, at the logical level, involved in and important to the defined business&#xD;
    processes. The roles implemented by the logical systems are incorporated into the model, optionally including&#xD;
    relationships to business functions (activities) involved with the role. Roles have a direct relationship to user&#xD;
    interactions with the system. That is, for every role users have within a system, there is a set of activities&#xD;
    (defining a business process) that include the user interfaces (show as User Tasks). Security is thus an important&#xD;
    aspect of this model as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot; name=&quot;XE_Logical_Perspective__Logical_Roles_Model&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The focus of the roles model is on all interactions with the business processes and activities, with the Logical Roles&#xD;
    representing the “interface protocol” (in the case of system interactions: Service Tasks) or “graphical user interface”&#xD;
    (GUI, in the case of human interactions: User Tasks) to the Logical Activities and Processes. At the Technical level&#xD;
    these definitions are not implementable but will clearly specify the required structure and content for these&#xD;
    interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the context of IT architecture and the Logical Roles Viewpoint, the Activities within this model do not represent&#xD;
    the complete business Activity, just the presentation layer or interface. These Logical Activities therefore represent&#xD;
    the boundary portion of the Logical Process Model—the Logical Process Model captures all Processes, Activities and&#xD;
    Tasks, but with the interface/GUI portion also being represented in the Logical Roles Model through a User Task (or&#xD;
    Service Task for system interactions). The Logical Roles Model is incomplete from a process perspective; therefore the&#xD;
    Logical Process Model defines the complete business solution for Processes and Activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Logical Roles Model is created&amp;nbsp;very early during the architecture development, and fully detailed and adjusted&#xD;
    as the architecture progresses. This artifact is enclosed within the Logical Perspective artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is important in deciding (in later models) on the presentation architecture activities / services, so&#xD;
    that usability concerns, integration concerns (at the &lt;em>user&lt;/em> level) and other issues are understood. Security&#xD;
    implications are also derived from this model, starting now at this Logical level (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;access to information /&#xD;
    services may be controlled based upon a user's Role: RBAC). &lt;span>It is important to clearly define the Logical Actors&#xD;
    and the interactions that they have with the system. This information is used by stakeholders, business-process&#xD;
    analysts and business designers to understand and improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by&#xD;
    systems analysts and software architects to provide context for software development and GUI designs.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Roles Model defines the structure of Logical Roles (each of which relates to an interface design or GUI),&#xD;
    along with the structure of Logical Actors.&amp;nbsp;Roles have a direct relationship to user interactions with the system,&#xD;
    that is, for every role users/actors have within a system, there is a set of activities that includes the user&#xD;
    interfaces. Security is thus an important aspect of this model at the Logical level.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>UML Representation&lt;/strong>: Package stereotyped as «LPL_LRM» containing class diagrams.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A &lt;strong>Logical Roles Model&lt;/strong> may have the following properties:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Introduction:&lt;/strong> A textual description that serves as a brief introduction to the model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Packages:&lt;/strong> The packages in the model, representing a hierarchy (contained within the Logical&#xD;
        Perspective package).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Role&lt;/strong>: The Roles in the model, owned by the packages stereotyped as&amp;nbsp;«LPL_Role».&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Actor:&lt;/strong> The Actors in the model, owned by the packages stereotyped as&amp;nbsp;«LPL_Actor».&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Activities:&lt;/strong> The&amp;nbsp;User Tasks in the model, stereotyped as «LPL_Task_User».&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Relationships:&lt;/strong> The relationships in the model, owned by the packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Diagrams:&lt;/strong> The diagrams in the model, owned by the packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Decide on the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The sub-package structure for the Logical Roles Model package: function-based structure or coherence/coupling&#xD;
        based;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Properties to include;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Whether or not any extensions to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) are needed; additional stereotypes or&#xD;
        profile&amp;nbsp;for example;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The level of formality&amp;nbsp;and detail in the model (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_logical_roles_model_9E48402E.html&quot;&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Whether a single model or multiple models will be used.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></representationOptions>
