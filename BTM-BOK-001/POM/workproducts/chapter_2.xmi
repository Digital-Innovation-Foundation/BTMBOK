    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What are the basic characteristics of managerial decision-making?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the two systems of decision-making in the brain?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What is the difference between programmed and nonprogrammed decisions?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What barriers exist that make effective decision-making difficult?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How can a manager improve the quality of her individual decision-making?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the advantages and disadvantages of group decision-making, and how can a manager improve the quality of group&#xD;
    decision-making?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Managers and business owners—like Jen Rubio and Stephanie Korey—make decisions on a daily basis. Some are big, like the&#xD;
    decision to start a new business, but most are smaller decisions that go into the regular running of the company and&#xD;
    are crucial to its long-term success. Some decisions are predictable, and some are unexpected. In this chapter we look&#xD;
    at important information about decision-making that can help you make better decisions and, ultimately, be a better&#xD;
    manager.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Up, Up, and Away: How Stephanie Korey and Jen Rubio founded their luggage company&lt;br />&#xD;
    Jen Rubio and Stephanie Korey faced a number of important decisions in starting their luggage company, Away—beginning&#xD;
    with the decision to start a business! That decision came about after Rubio’s luggage broke on a trip. She found it&#xD;
    frustrating that all the luggage options were either inexpensive ($100 or less) but low quality, or high quality but&#xD;
    incredibly expensive ($400 and above). There was no midrange option. So in 2015 Rubio and her friend Stephanie Korey&#xD;
    began researching the luggage industry. They found that much of the reason for the high prices on quality luggage was&#xD;
    because of how it was distributed and sold, through specialty retail shops and department stores. If they opted instead&#xD;
    for a model in which they sold directly to consumers, they could provide high-quality luggage at more of a midrange&#xD;
    ($200-$300) price. After considerable research, the two were convinced that they had an idea worth pursuing. Rubio and&#xD;
    Korey settled on the company name “Away,” which is intended to invoke the pleasure that comes from travelling.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Both of the founders had prior experience working for a start-up in the e-commerce space (Warby Parker), which helped&#xD;
    them with making sound choices. Rubio’s background was more in branding and marketing, while Korey’s was in operations&#xD;
    and supply chain management—so each was able to bring great expertise to various aspects of the business. They raised&#xD;
    money initially from friends and family, but within a few months they sought venture capital funding to ensure that&#xD;
    they had enough money to get off to a successful start.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A big decision that Rubio and Korey had to make fairly early in the process of establishing their business was to&#xD;
    settle on an initial design for the product. This decision required extensive marketing and consumer research to&#xD;
    understand customer needs and wants. They asked hundreds of people what they liked about their existing luggage, and&#xD;
    what they found most irritating about their existing luggage. They also contracted with a two-person design team to&#xD;
    help create the first prototype. This research and development ultimately led to the design of an attractive hard case&#xD;
    that is surprisingly lightweight. It also boasts extremely high-quality wheels (four of them, not two) and high-quality&#xD;
    zippers. As a bonus, the carry-on includes a built-in battery for charging phones and other devices.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The two founders also had to choose a partner to manufacture their product. Because their product had a hard,&#xD;
    polycarbonate shell, Rubio and Korey discovered that manufacturing in the United States was not a viable option—the&#xD;
    vast majority of luggage manufacturers using a polycarbonate shell were based in Asia. They researched a number of&#xD;
    possible business partners and asked lots of questions. In addition, they eventually visited all of the factories on&#xD;
    their list of options to see what they were actually like. This was an important piece of research, because the&#xD;
    companies that looked best on paper didn’t always turn out to be the best when they visited in person. Rubio and Korey&#xD;
    ended up working with a manufacturing partner in China that also produces luggage for many high-end brands, and they&#xD;
    have been extremely pleased with the partnership. They continue to devote time to building and maintaining that&#xD;
    relationship, which helps to avoid issues and problems that might otherwise come up.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By the end of 2015, Rubio and Korey had developed their first product. Because the luggage was not going to be&#xD;
    available in time for the holiday shopping season, they decided to allow customers to preorder the luggage. To drum up&#xD;
    interest, the duo engaged in a unique storytelling effort. They interviewed 40 well-respected members of the creative&#xD;
    community about their travel experiences and created a hardcover book of travel memoirs called The Places We Return To.&#xD;
    Not only was the book interesting and engaging, it also made lots of people in the creative community aware of Away&#xD;
    luggage. Starting in November 2015, the travel memoir book was available for free with the purchase of a gift card that&#xD;
    could be redeemed in February 2016 for luggage. The book project generated tremendous advance interest in the product,&#xD;
    and the 1,200 printed copies sold out. Away generated $12 million in first-year sales.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stephanie Corey and Jen Rubio faced many important and novel decisions in initially developing and building their&#xD;
    business. They have been successful in part because they made those decisions wisely—by relying on shared knowledge,&#xD;
    expertise, and lots of research before reaching a decision. They will continue to face many decisions, big and small.&#xD;
    They have expanded their product line from one piece of luggage to four, with more luggage—and other travel&#xD;
    accessories—in the works for the future. Their company, which is based in New York, has grown to over 60 employees in&#xD;
    the first two years. These employees include the two design-team members who were contracted to help create their first&#xD;
    prototype; Rubio and Korey appreciated working with them so much, they offered them full-time positions with Away. Each&#xD;
    new hire represents new decisions—decisions about what additional work needs to be done and who they should hire to do&#xD;
    it. Each new product also brings additional decisions—but it seems Rubio and Korey have positioned themselves (and&#xD;
    their business) well for future successes.&#xD;
