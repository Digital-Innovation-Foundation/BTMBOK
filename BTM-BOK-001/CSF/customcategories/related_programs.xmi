    The Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder, Version 1.1 is a self-assessment tool to help organizations better&#xD;
    understand the effectiveness of their cybersecurity risk management efforts and identity improvement opportunities in&#xD;
    the context of their overall organizational performance. This self-assessment tool blends organizational assessment&#xD;
    approaches from the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program with the concepts and principles of the Cybersecurity&#xD;
    Framework developed by NIST’s Applied Cybersecurity Division.&lt;br />&#xD;

    in many organizations. It also includes informative references that are common across critical infrastructure sectors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Are External Assessments Available?&lt;br />&#xD;
    In Phase 1 of the initiative, the Baldrige Program teamed up with NIST’s Applied Cybersecurity Division responsible for&#xD;
    the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, to develop a self-assessment tool, using a phased approach and input from numerous&#xD;
    industry sources.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Pending funding, Phase 2 would involve voluntary assessments by independent experts, sharing of best practices, and&#xD;
    voluntary recognition for exceptional performance.&#xD;
