  <mainDescription>At the Logical level, rules are transformed into something that is usable within the system; they are defined in a more&#xD;
logical and rigorous way.&amp;nbsp;Some structure&amp;nbsp;to the rules may be defined. This model is aimed at&#xD;
technical&amp;nbsp;people, with the goal of ensuring that it is clearly understood usable by this audience.</mainDescription>
  <sections xmi:id="_szZX9mX6EeSFL7Sh0MlmKA" name="Clear name and description" guid="_szZX9mX6EeSFL7Sh0MlmKA">
    <sectionDescription>Ensure that the name for the rule conveys its meaning and that the description supports this meaning. Business experts and&#xD;
stakeholders are key to ensuring that this is the case, but technical experts will ensure that the defined rules are usable&#xD;
with systems.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>In this age of totally interconnected systems it is imperative that the owners of rules are identified since they must be&#xD;
involved in making decisions regarding their meaning and usage, along with who is the authority for updates. The owner, or&#xD;
their representative, should approve the defined rules to ensure their accuracy and completeness.</sectionDescription>
