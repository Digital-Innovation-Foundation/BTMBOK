    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What has been the evolution of human resource management over the years, and what is the current value it provides to&#xD;
    an organization?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How does the human resources compliance role of HR provide value to a company?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do performance management practices impact company performance?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do companies use rewards strategies to influence employee performance and motivation?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What is talent acquisition, and how can it create a competitive advantage for a company?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the benefits of talent development and succession planning?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Human resource management is an area that has evolved a great deal over the last few decades. From the days of the very&#xD;
    tactical “personnel” management to the current and more strategic state of human resources, businesses and HR&#xD;
    professionals alike have changed the way they see the function. In the current economy, human capital assets (i.e.,&#xD;
    people) are the greatest value creators. Companies compete for talent, and they distinguish themselves in their&#xD;
    business performance by the talent they have in their ranks. Human resource management, therefore, becomes a key lever&#xD;
    companies can utilize to find, recruit, develop, and grow talent for competitive advantage. This chapter discusses the&#xD;
    value and benefits that human resource management brings to an organization, as well as the challenges that the&#xD;
    function still faces as a strategic partner to the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
