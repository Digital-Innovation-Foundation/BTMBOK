    This section introduces a number of commonly used Project Management Tools &amp;amp; Techniques useful for dealing with
    various project management challenges. Each Tool &amp;amp; Technique is summarised in a few paragraphs providing a simple
    and high-level overview of that tool or technique.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Note that the set of tools presented is not an exhaustive list of Project Management Tools &amp;amp; Techniques available.
    Relevant sources for further reading and exploration are also presented at the end of this section.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>1. PESTEL Analysis&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The PESTEL Analysis is used to understand how the environment might impact a project or an objective. PESTEL stands
    for: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal. A PESTEL analysis helps identify the external
    factors that influence an organisation, and therefore, could have an impact on the objectives, planning or execution of
    projects.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    This type of analysis is particularly important in the context of business justification and risk management and will
    feed the process of designing a plan comprehensive enough to identify and tackle potential risk scenarios
    (threats/opportunities) arising from outside the organisation or project.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>2. Make or Buy Analysis&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    A Make or Buy Analysis helps the organisation to take an informed decision about what to outsource and what not to
    outsource. Portfolio managers and project sponsors are often faced with the dilemma to make or buy, considering the
    availability and skills of resources at hand.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The various factors to be considered for a Make or Buy Analysis include cost comparison, technology and business
    processes, supplier-related information and support systems.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Potential reasons for a make decision include cost effectiveness, intellectual property concerns, quality control
    issues or supplier unreliability issues. Potential reasons for buy decision include cost considerations, lack of
    technical expertise, suppliers’ technical experience and/or insufficient in-house resources.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>3. Stakeholder Interest/Influence Matrix (SIIM)&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    This technique is used to facilitate and document the analysis of the interest and influence of each stakeholder in the
    project. It is of utmost importance to know the stakeholders and their relevance for the project in order to identify
    project champions and possible detractors. As the document makes reference to people within your organisation, care
    should be used to keep the information confidential.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>Interest&lt;/strong> indicates the level of interest a stakeholder has for the project. Interest is measured as
    the degree of enthusiasm displayed by the stakeholder in support of the project. Stakeholders can be positive, neutral
    or negative towards the project.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>Influence&lt;/strong> indicates the power the stakeholder has over the planning and implementation of activities.
    The higher a stakeholder’s power of decision, the higher their influence. Most often the person(s) who can make
    decisions on project funding and/or resources has a high influence.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>4. Risk Likelihood/Impact Matrix&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Risk Likelihood/Impact Matrix (sometimes called the Likelihood-Impact Matrix or Risk Matrix) is used in the
    qualitative assessment of risks, after the project risks have been identified. The matrix is designed as a tool to
    supplement the risk log or risk register.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Risk Likelihood/Impact Matrix is based on two criteria: the likelihood that a risk will materialise and the
    potential impact caused by the risk event. Most commonly five bands are used for each of the dimensions (also called
    bands) of the matrix: 1=Very low, 2=Low, 3=Medium, 4=High, 5=Very high.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The two factors are then combined by multiplying their values, resulting in the Risk Level. Measured on a relative
    scale from 1 to 25, the Risk Level will trigger different risk response strategies.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The cells of the matrix are painted in different colours to indicate the criticality of the risk, typically Green for
    low-level risks (risk level &amp;lt;=2), Yellow for medium-level risks (risk level between 3 and 16), and Red for
    high-level risks (risk level &amp;gt;=20). Based on the risk appetite of the organisation, adequate risk-response
    strategies can be developed for each identified risk.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>5. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical division of the project into smaller work components that can be
    used to assign work or to estimate effort and cost. A well-made Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) should be easy to
    understand, be complete, and should facilitate progress monitoring during execution. Commonly used techniques include
    breaking down the project by phases or stages, deliverables or outputs, by work packages, or based on the organisation,
    its departments and business units.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) constitutes a good basis for the Project Manager (PM) in assigning different
    responsibilities to team members. Each task in the structure can then be further defined: work can be estimated, risks
    and dependencies can be identified, and resources can be mobilised.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>6. Deliverables Breakdown Structure (DBS)&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    A Deliverables Breakdown Structure (DBS) is an essential part of Product Based Planning. It can be used to identify and
    document the deliverables of a project (both project deliverables and project management deliverables) and their
    interdependencies. This results in a hierarchical tree of deliverables and sub-deliverables (physical, functional or
    conceptual) that make up the entire project, which helps the project team to identify the full set of deliverables that
    comprise the project.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    A Deliverables Breakdown Structure (DBS) is similar to a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) but is used at a different step
    in the planning process. The former can precede the latter and identifies the desired outputs (deliverables) which are
    then used in the creation of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)—identification of tasks and activities required to
    deliver these outputs.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    You could say that the Deliverables Breakdown Structure (DBS) defines what the project will produce (as a whole and as
    parts), and the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) defines the work needed to produce them.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>7. Effort and Cost Estimates&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Effort and Cost Estimates technique derives from the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): each work item (task) is
    estimated in terms of effort and cost. Effort is typically measured in person days or person months. This work is done
    in close cooperation with the task owners or other experts within the Project Core Team (PCT), to ensure more precise
    estimates and buy-in from the team members in charge of executing the work.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    A high-quality Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) forms the basis for high-quality estimates.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>8. Three-Point Estimates&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Three-Point Estimate is commonly used, in conjunctions with Network Diagrams, to provide a weighted average of
    activity duration or cost. It is primarily a quantitative risk assessment technique that makes use of a stochastic
    approach rather than a deterministic one (e.g. single point estimates). The expected duration/cost and standard
    deviation of a project’s duration or cost is calculated based on three data points, namely an optimistic estimate of
    duration or cost, a most likely estimate and a pessimistic estimate. These estimates are then weighed to provide a
    weighted average of the effort, cost or duration.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    In addition, these estimates can be used to calculate a standard deviation, to estimate confidence levels of the
    weighted average per activity, and to build simple statistical models of a task’s time and cost. This method can be
    applied to forecast and mitigate risk and to assign buffers/contingencies to tasks. Nowadays, numerous Project
    Management Software, can perform automated calculation of the above through modelling and simulation (e.g.&amp;nbsp; by
    using the Beta-PERT distribution).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Involving experts increases the accuracy of the three-point estimates and reduces the degree of uncertainty of the
    project.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>9. Decision Trees&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The decision tree is a visual decision support tool, consisting of nodes and branches that helps us describe possible
    alternatives (paths) by representing choices, and events with different likelihood of occurrence. It uses three types
    of nodes: (a) Decision nodes (represented by squares) (b) Chance nodes (represented by circles) and (c) End nodes
    (represented by triangles).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    In decision tree analysis (primarily being performed during project risk management), the decision tree is principally
    used in conjunction with the Expected Monetary Value (EMV) where we compute the EMV of each alternative (branch) and
    thus select the most favourable one. The decision tree analysis can also be performed by creating a stochastically
    determined structure and then simulate the outcomes (e.g. through Monte Carlo simulation), in order to derive to
    probability-based decisions.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>10. Project Scheduling&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Project Scheduling aims to identify dependencies between tasks, to assign resources for each task, to identify task
    start and end dates, and to work out the overall project duration.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Scheduling can be done for the entire project upfront or for portions thereof, such as individual stages or iterations.
    Different scheduling methods and representations can be used: a list of dates/deadlines, a milestone plan, bar charts,
    network diagrams and linked bar charts (Gantt charts), all of which can be seen complementary to each other.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Once approved, the project schedule is baselined and any further change to the schedule needs to follow the change
    management process and the corresponding governance arrangements.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>11. Resource Levelling&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Resource Levelling is a technique used to analyse the unbalanced use of project resources and to resolve conflicts
    related to resource allocation (i.e. human resources, material or equipment).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Resource Levelling focuses on an efficient/optimal resource allocation in order for the project to be completed within
    the defined timeline. Project Managers (PMs) analyse dependencies between projects or activities to ensure that
    activities can be executed in a timely manner. Taking into account the identified constraints, Resource Levelling can
    be performed. Resource Levelling can for example require the delay of specific tasks until resources are available,
    resource reallocation etc.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>12. Gantt Charts&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    A Gantt Chart is a common project management tool used to represent the schedule, phases and activities of a project in
    a single visual (generally a type of horizontal bar chart). It focuses on project sequence, duration, dependencies and
    status in a manner that is easy to understand.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    A Gantt Chart represents the order in which activities need to be carried out and provides an overview of the progress
    that has been achieved at any point in time. A Gantt Chart is used to communicate a project schedule in a visual way
    but is also used to show progress made and current schedule status by adding percent-complete shadings and a vertical
    “today” line. The main strength of this technique is the ability to clearly display the status of each activity at a
    glance.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>13. Critical Path Method (CPM)&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Critical Path Method (CPM) is a modelling technique that uses a mathematically based algorithm to calculate the
    total duration of a project. It calculates the longest necessary path (i.e. the longest unavoidable duration) of
    planned activities from beginning to the end of the project, otherwise known as the critical path of the project. This
    technique helps to understand which activities have a critical influence on the overall duration of the project.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Since the critical path represents the longest necessary path of activities, it also represents the shortest possible
    duration of the project to completion. Based on this information, activities can be prioritised in order to shorten the
    duration of the critical path by pruning the critical path activities, performing more activities in parallel or adding
    more resources.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    &lt;strong>14. Critical Chain Method (CCM)&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Critical Chain Method (CCM) is a modelling technique used to plan and schedule a set of activities or projects. It
    is similar to the Critical Path Method (CPM), but takes into account resources and their levelling, as well as the
    behaviour of the Project Manager (PM) when estimating the duration of project activities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The technique is based on the observation that activity time estimates for projects are close to double the time
    required to complete the activities. Reasons that lead to a delay can include not taking advantage of the early finish
    of an activity, pacing of the team members to fill the time available for the completion of a task, waiting until the
    last moment to really focus on the task at hand, etc.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Critical Chain Method (CCM) assumes that a Project Manager’s (PM) estimates of duration for activities are padded,
    and immediately proceeds to reduce them. Additional buffers (project buffer, feeding buffer, resource buffer) are then
    added to account for the reduction in project estimates.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>15. Earned Value Management (EVM)&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Earned Value Management (EVM) is a technique used to monitor and control the performance of projects, providing an
    objective view of performance based on the project financials. Both cost and value are measured in terms of cost units
    (e.g. person days or euro). Earned Value Management (EVM) provides relatively objective metrics—or key performance
    indicators (KPIs)—to proactively manage project performance. Some indicators reflect on progress made so far, or
    deviations from the plan from a cost or work value point of view, while other indicators focus on forecasting total
    budget deviation, or on the productivity levels required to complete the project on schedule.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The principal metrics being used are the Planned Value (PV), also known as Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS), the
    Actual Cost (AC), also known as Actual Cost of Work Performed (AVWP) and the Earned Value, also known as Budgeted Cost
    of Work Performed (BCWP). Through the combination of the above metrics we can have various KPIs, e.g. Schedule Variance
    (SV) and Schedule performance Index (SPI), Cost Variance (CV) and Cost Performance Index (CPI) or even more advanced
    ones for forecasting future project performance, like the Estimate at Completion (EAC), the Estimate to Complete (ETC)
    and the To Complete Performance Index (TCPI).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>16. Pareto Analysis&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Pareto Analysis is a formal technique to identify those issues that cause the majority of problems in a project.
    The Pareto principle states that generally 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes (e.g. 80% of costs may be
    attributed to 20% of activities or 80% of risk effects may arise from just 20% of identified risks).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    By focusing on these top issues (the 20%), the Pareto Analysis can be useful for risk or quality management as it helps
    to focus on those risks or quality issues with the highest impact on a project, therefore facilitating the
    prioritisation of necessary mitigation or contingency actions.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>17. Lessons Learned&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Capturing Lessons Learned is a way of identifying areas for development/improvement within a project for the purpose of
    helping similar projects avoid certain pitfalls in the future. Information that can be captured includes Lessons
    Learned from the management of risks, quality issues, outsourcing or contractor issues, change requests, etc.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The project team can capture ideas through brainstorming sessions, reviewing project reports and logs, sending project
    questionnaires, etc., during the lifecycle of the project. The Project Manager (PM) will group and prioritise Lessons
    Learned in order to understand key potential improvement areas.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    To avoid making the same mistakes twice, Lessons Learned should be shared with other project managers. In some cases,
    Lessons Learned can lead to process improvements, enhanced checklists and templates, or more effective training
    courses.&lt;br />
