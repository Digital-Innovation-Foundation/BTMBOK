    It would be convenient to assume that all PM² Project Managers (PMs) operate within their organisations in a homogenous
    environment and with consistent levels of authority and responsibility. This is generally not the case, however.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There are typically several ways of organising projects within an organisation, which utilise one of the following
    structures or a combination of them.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h5>
    The Functional Structure
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    In a functional organisational structure, project work is integrated into the work performed by the permanent
    organisation. Project members and other resources are ‘borrowed’ from multiple sections of the functional organisation.
    The Project Manager (PM) tends to have limited authority and needs to involve senior management in the management of
    important project issues. Project work is often viewed as having lower priority than everyday work.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h5>
    The Projectised Structure
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    On the other end of the spectrum, in a projectised organisation, there is only a basic permanent (functional)
    hierarchy, and all work is organised and performed within temporary project organisations. Project resources are
    brought together specifically for the purpose of a project and work more or less exclusively for the project. At the
    end of the project, resources are either reassigned to another project or returned to a resource pool.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h5>
    The Matrix Structure
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    A matrix organisation is a blended organisational structure. Additional temporary project organisations are created
    alongside the functional hierarchy to achieve specific project goals and work. The role of the Project Manager (PM) is
    recognised as central and key to the project’s success, and the Project Steering Committee (PSC) typically delegates
    enough authority and responsibility to the Project Manager (PM) and the Business Manager (BM) for them to manage the
    project and its resources. Matrix organisations can be further categorised as weak, balanced and strong matrix
    organisations, the difference being the level of authority and autonomy given to the project organisation.
