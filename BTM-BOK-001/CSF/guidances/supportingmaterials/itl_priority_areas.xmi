    Cybersecurity&lt;br />&#xD;
    With a world-class measurement and testing laboratory encompassing a wide range of areas of computer science,&#xD;
    mathematics, statistics, and systems engineering, NIST’s cybersecurity program supports its overall mission to promote&#xD;
    U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and related technology&#xD;
    through research and development in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The need for cybersecurity standards and best practices that address interoperability, usability and privacy continues&#xD;
    to be critical for the nation. NIST’s cybersecurity programs seek to enable greater development and application of&#xD;
    practical, innovative security technologies and methodologies that enhance the country’s ability to address current and&#xD;
    future computer and information security challenges.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Internet of Things&lt;br />&#xD;
    WHAT IS THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) AND HOW CAN WE SECURE IT?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Artificial Intelligence&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why is Artificial Intelligence (AI) important?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world. Remarkable surges in AI capabilities have led to a&#xD;
    number of innovations including autonomous vehicles and connected Internet of Things devices in our homes. AI is even&#xD;
    contributing to the development of a brain-controlled robotic arm that can help a paralyzed person feel again through&#xD;
    complex direct human-brain interfaces. These new AI-enabled systems are revolutionizing everything from commerce and&#xD;
    healthcare to transportation and cybersecurity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    AI has the potential to impact nearly all aspects of our society, including our economy, but the development and use of&#xD;
    the new technologies it brings are not without technical challenges and risks. AI must be developed in a trustworthy&#xD;
    manner to ensure reliability, safety and accuracy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Cultivating Trust in AI Technologies&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST has a long-standing reputation for cultivating trust in technology by participating in the development of&#xD;
    standards and metrics that strengthen measurement science and make technology more secure, usable, interoperable and&#xD;
    reliable. This work is critical in the AI space to ensure public trust of rapidly evolving technologies, so that we can&#xD;
    benefit from all that this field has to promise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    AI systems typically make decisions based on data-driven models created by machine learning, or the system’s ability to&#xD;
    detect and derive patterns. As the technology advances, we will need to develop rigorous scientific testing that&#xD;
    ensures secure, trustworthy and safe AI. We also need to develop a broad spectrum of standards for AI data,&#xD;
    performance, interoperability, usability, security and privacy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NIST's Role&lt;br />&#xD;
    Interagency Engagement&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST participates in interagency efforts to further innovation in AI. NIST Director and Undersecretary of Commerce for&#xD;
    Standards and Technology Walter Copan serves on the White House Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence. Charles&#xD;
    Romine, Director of NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory, serves on the Machine Learning and AI Subcommittee.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A February 11, 2019, Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence tasks NIST with&#xD;
    developing “a plan for Federal engagement in the development of technical standards and related tools in support of&#xD;
    reliable, robust, and trustworthy systems that use AI technologies.” For more information, see: &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/topics/artificial-intelligence/ai-standards&quot;>https://www.nist.gov/topics/artificial-intelligence/ai-standards&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Research&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST research in AI is focused on how to measure and enhance the security and trustworthiness of AI systems. This&#xD;
    includes participation in the development of international standards that ensure innovation, public trust and&#xD;
    confidence in systems that use AI technologies. In addition, NIST is applying AI to measurement problems to gain deeper&#xD;
    insight into the research itself as well as to better understand AI’s capabilities and limitations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NIST AI program has two major goals:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Advancing application of AI to NIST metrology problems by bolstering AI expertise at NIST and enabling NIST scientists&#xD;
    to draw routinely on machine learning and AI tools to gain deeper insight into their research; and&lt;br />&#xD;
    Fundamental research to measure and enhance the security and explainability of AI systems.&lt;br />&#xD;
    The recently launched AI Visiting Fellow program brings nationally recognized leaders in AI and machine learning to&#xD;
    NIST to share their knowledge and experience and to provide technical support.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reliable Computing (coming soon)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Future Computing Technologies and Applications (coming soon)&#xD;
