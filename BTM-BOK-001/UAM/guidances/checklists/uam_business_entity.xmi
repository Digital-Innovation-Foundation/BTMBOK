  <mainDescription>At the Business level, entities are kept simple, with only simple associations defined between them. No structure (i.e.&#xD;
generalization or aggregation) is permitted. This is left until the Logical level within IT architectures. The objective is&#xD;
to make this model easily consumable by business people, with the goal to ensuring that this level is understood and agreed&#xD;
to by all stakeholders.</mainDescription>
  <sections xmi:id="_porwwFrIEeSU46-vxLGKFw" name="Clear name and description" guid="_porwwFrIEeSU46-vxLGKFw">
    <sectionDescription>Ensure that the name for the entity conveys its meaning and that the description supports this meaning. Business experts&#xD;
and stakeholders are key to ensuring that this is the case.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_9gK4kFrIEeSU46-vxLGKFw" name="Relationships are useful and well defined" guid="_9gK4kFrIEeSU46-vxLGKFw">
    <sectionDescription>Relationships between entities support the business: they support the business processes and also business management&#xD;
requirements. They are therefore very important and needs to be identified and clearly defined. Note that no structure is&#xD;
defined; definition of aggregation and generalization relationships are left to the Logical Level.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>In this age of totally interconnected systems it is imperative that the owners of information are identified since they&#xD;
must be involved in making decisions regarding the usage and protections afforded to entities.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_xkAMEFrJEeSU46-vxLGKFw" name="Business events and the entity" guid="_xkAMEFrJEeSU46-vxLGKFw">

Payment&quot; process.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_KGdOMFrKEeSU46-vxLGKFw" name="Define important attributes" guid="_KGdOMFrKEeSU46-vxLGKFw">

requirements among others.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_cfT00FrKEeSU46-vxLGKFw" name="Is the entity persistent" guid="_cfT00FrKEeSU46-vxLGKFw">
    <sectionDescription>This is an optional level of analysis at the Business level. If an entity is important enough to be identified and defined,&#xD;
it is likely persistent. However if there is some question, examine this aspect and add it to the entity description.</sectionDescription>
