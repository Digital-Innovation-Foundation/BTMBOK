  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A role is played in relation to the business by someone or something in the business environment. A role is equated or&#xD;
    defined by the behavior (and by extension its responsibilities) that it interacts with in the system — the activities&#xD;
    that it interacts with. A role is in essence the “interface” to the activities with which it interacts. Business Roles&#xD;
    are high-level conceptualizations of the Roles with the system; further analysis is required to fully understand and&#xD;
    define required roles. A role can be assumed (aggregated) by any kind of actor, either human or a system. An actor may&#xD;
    be aggregate multiple roles, and an actor can be associated with multiple physical people (or systems). Roles also&#xD;
    include security concepts and constructs. An employee of the enterprise is typically multiple actors with the system&#xD;
    and therefore has many different roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore Roles are a categorization, based upon specific interactions with the system ... the interfaces.&amp;nbsp;These&#xD;
    interfaces may eventually be defined as&amp;nbsp;either human (i.e. GUIs) or as interfaces with other systems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>NOTE&lt;/strong>: Roles are not defined at the Business level, but they may be rolled back into the Business&#xD;
    Perspective once defined at the Logical Perspective, in order to facilitate a more complete descriptions for business&#xD;
    stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to IT Architects, the following people are interested in Roles:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Business Analysts&lt;/b>, when defining the boundaries of the organization and business processes;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Business designers&lt;/b>, when describing business processes and their interaction with business&#xD;
        actors;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
