  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The manufacturing sector is quite broad, including automotive, textile, electronics, and pharmaceutical companies.&#xD;
    These organizations typically use power-driven machines or materials-handling equipment that rely on a network&#xD;
    infrastructure. As these machines become more connected via the internet, new opportunities for cyber-attacks arise.&#xD;
    Cybersecurity experts at the NCCoE are working with manufacturing sector stakeholders and technology vendors to develop&#xD;
    practical example solutions to some of the sectorâ€™s most pressing cybersecurity challenges.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
