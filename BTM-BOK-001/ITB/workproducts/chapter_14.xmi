    Using Financial Informtion and Accounting&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Why are financial reports and accounting information important, and who uses them?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the differences between public and private accountants, and how has federal legislation affected their&#xD;
    work?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the six steps in the accounting cycle?&lt;br />&#xD;
    In what terms does the balance sheet describe the financial condition of an organization?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How does the income statement report a firm’s profitability?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why is the statement of cash flows an important source of information?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How can ratio analysis be used to identify a firm’s financial strengths and weaknesses?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What major trends affect the accounting industry today?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Financial information is central to every organization. To operate effectively, businesses must have a way to track&#xD;
    income, expenses, assets, and liabilities in an organized manner. Financial information is also essential for&#xD;
    decision-making. Managers prepare financial reports using accounting, a set of procedures and guidelines for companies&#xD;
    to follow when preparing financial reports. Unless you understand basic accounting concepts, you will not be able to&#xD;
    “speak” the standard financial language of businesses. This module examines the role of accounting in business, how&#xD;
    accounting contributes to a company’s overall success, the three primary financial statements, and careers in&#xD;
    accounting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Theresa Lee&lt;br />&#xD;
    Future Glory&lt;br />&#xD;
    Theresa Lee always knew she would start her own business; it was just a matter of time. In 2013, after working as a&#xD;
    designer in the Bay Area for more than a decade, Lee cofounded Future Glory, which specializes in handmade leather bags&#xD;
    and accessories, now made in a small studio in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Lee would be the first to tell you that she is a creative person and not so great with numbers and other business&#xD;
    details. But the business details, including financial statements and cash flow, are key to any company. That’s where&#xD;
    accounting software like QuickBooks Online comes in handy. QuickBooks is a global online accounting program that has&#xD;
    helped tech-savvy entrepreneurs take the worry out of crunching the numbers that can make or break their business&#xD;
    ventures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Intuit, the global leader in accounting software, has revolutionized the approach taken by small businesses with its&#xD;
    products, including QuickBooks and TurboTax, programs that can be used by new businesses, independent contractors,&#xD;
    product sellers, accountants, and other types of businesses. The company estimates more than two million global&#xD;
    customers are currently using the online version of QuickBooks. Intuit provides online support that includes expert&#xD;
    help, a resource blog, accounting advice, and other features utilized by QuickBooks users and those wanting more&#xD;
    information about how to track typical business accounting functions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As Lee points out, using a cloud-based accounting program has helped her gain control over company finances and&#xD;
    provided insight into key business components such as profit and loss, cost of goods sold, and labor. In addition,&#xD;
    QuickBooks’ ability to work with other apps has helped her manage e-commerce sales efficiently. Lee uses Shopify as an&#xD;
    e-commerce platform and PayPal as a payment system. By using a version of these apps designed to work with QuickBooks,&#xD;
    Lee can import sales data (line items, fees, and taxes) as well as customer information into the accounting program. In&#xD;
    addition, Shopify e-commerce data automatically syncs with QuickBooks, allowing her to keep bookkeeping activities to a&#xD;
    minimum and giving her more time to focus on designing and creating new products and fulfilling the social goals of her&#xD;
    business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    According to Lee, a significant part of her operation is dedicated to providing training and jobs to members of the&#xD;
    local community. In addition, Future Glory supports various social causes, donating a portion of revenue to various&#xD;
    organizations that assistant women and children in need.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Keeping a close eye on financial and accounting information is an important part of any business, whether it’s a&#xD;
    startup or a global conglomerate. The continuing revolution in technology has enabled bookkeeping and accounting&#xD;
    activities to be done more efficiently while giving business owners, particularly small businesses like Future Glory,&#xD;
    the time to spend expanding their business and giving back to their local communities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
