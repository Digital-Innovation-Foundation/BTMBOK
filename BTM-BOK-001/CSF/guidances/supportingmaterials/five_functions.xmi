    An Introduction to the Functions&lt;br />&#xD;
    The five Functions included in the Framework Core are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify&lt;br />&#xD;
    Protect&lt;br />&#xD;
    Detect&lt;br />&#xD;
    Respond&lt;br />&#xD;
    Recover&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The Functions are the highest level of abstraction included in the Framework. They act as the backbone of the Framework&#xD;
    Core that all other elements are organized around.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These five Functions were selected because they represent the five primary pillars for a successful and holistic&#xD;
    cybersecurity program. They aid organizations in easily expressing their management of cybersecurity risk at a high&#xD;
    level and enabling risk management decisions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Identify Function assists in developing an organizational understanding to managing cybersecurity risk to systems,&#xD;
    people, assets, data, and capabilities. Understanding the business context, the resources that support critical&#xD;
    functions, and the related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to focus and prioritize its efforts, consistent&#xD;
    with its risk management strategy and business needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples of outcome Categories within this Function include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identifying physical and software assets within the organization to establish the basis of an Asset Management&#xD;
    program&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identifying the Business Environment the organization supports including the organization's role in the supply chain,&#xD;
    and the organizations place in the critical infrastructure sector&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identifying cybersecurity policies established within the organization to define the Governance program as well as&#xD;
    identifying legal and regulatory requirements regarding the cybersecurity capabilities of the organization&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identifying asset vulnerabilities, threats to internal and external organizational resources, and risk response&#xD;
    activities as a basis for the organizations Risk Assessment&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identifying a Risk Management Strategy for the organization including establishing risk tolerances&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identifying a Supply Chain Risk Management strategy including priorities, constraints, risk tolerances, and assumptions&#xD;
    used to support risk decisions associated with managing supply chain risks&lt;br />&#xD;
    Protect&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Protect Function outlines appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services. The&#xD;
    Protect Function supports the ability to limit or contain the impact of a potential cybersecurity event.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples of outcome Categories within this Function include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Protections for Identity Management and Access Control within the organization including physical and remote&#xD;
    access&lt;br />&#xD;
    Empowering staff within the organization through Awareness and Training including role based and privileged user&#xD;
    training&lt;br />&#xD;
    Establishing Data Security protection consistent with the organizationâ€™s risk strategy to protect the confidentiality,&#xD;
    integrity, and availability of information&lt;br />&#xD;
    Implementing Information Protection Processes and Procedures to maintain and manage the protections of information&#xD;
    systems and assets&lt;br />&#xD;
    Protecting organizational resources through Maintenance, including remote maintenance, activities&lt;br />&#xD;
    Managing Protective Technology to ensure the security and resilience of systems and assists are consistent with&#xD;
    organizational policies, procedures, and agreements&lt;br />&#xD;
    Detect&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Detect Function defines the appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event. The Detect&#xD;
    Function enables timely discovery of cybersecurity events.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples of outcome Categories within this Function include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ensuring Anomalies and Events are detected, and their potential impact is understood&lt;br />&#xD;
    Implementing Security Continuous Monitoring capabilities to monitor cybersecurity events and verify the effectiveness&#xD;
    of protective measures including network and physical activities&lt;br />&#xD;
    Maintaining Detection Processes to provide awareness of anomalous events&lt;br />&#xD;
    Respond&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Respond Function includes appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident. The&#xD;
    Respond Function supports the ability to contain the impact of a potential cybersecurity incident.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples of outcome Categories within this Function include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ensuring Response Planning process are executed during and after an incident&lt;br />&#xD;
    Managing Communications during and after an event with stakeholders, law enforcement, external stakeholders as&#xD;
    appropriate&lt;br />&#xD;
    Analysis is conducted to ensure effective response and support recovery activities including forensic analysis, and&#xD;
    determining the impact of incidents&lt;br />&#xD;
    Mitigation activities are performed to prevent expansion of an event and to resolve the incident&lt;br />&#xD;
    The organization implements Improvements by incorporating lessons learned from current and previous detection /&#xD;
    response activities&lt;br />&#xD;
    Recover&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;The Recover Function identifies appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any&#xD;
    capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident. The Recover Function supports timely&#xD;
    recovery to normal operations to reduce the impact from a cybersecurity incident.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples of outcome Categories within this Function include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ensuring the organization implements Recovery Planning processes and procedures to restore systems and/or assets&#xD;
    affected by cybersecurity incidents&lt;br />&#xD;
    Implementing Improvements based on lessons learned and reviews of existing strategies&lt;br />&#xD;
    Internal and external Communications are coordinated during and following the recovery from a cybersecurity&#xD;
    incident&lt;br />&#xD;
