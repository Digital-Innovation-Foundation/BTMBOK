&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business entities represent &quot;things&quot; consumed or produced by business activities. A business entity represents&#xD;
    something of value to the enterprise, therefore&amp;nbsp;the business entity is likely persistent. Business entities may&#xD;
    represent real-world objects within the IT architecture, &lt;em>customer&lt;/em> or &lt;em>report&lt;/em> for example, and as such&#xD;
    they will have relationships with many other entities within the architecture. These business entities in general will&#xD;
    have attributes reflecting their purpose, a representation of a physical object like a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>customer&lt;/em> for&#xD;
    example, but should not have attributes that define how and by whom it should be used. The workflow attributes and&#xD;
    rules are separate objects themselves. Also see the definition for &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/termdefinitions/uam_business_entity_4E0C32F9.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_Zm-s8MI7EeKSedlRPHdUIQ&quot;>Business Entity&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When modeling a business the entities are often representations of real-world objectsâ€”we are modeling the business as&#xD;
    reflected in and supported by the information technology (IT) after all. The physical aspects of the business need to&#xD;
    be reflected in the IT environment. Note however that IT concepts such as &lt;em>storage&lt;/em> do not appear at the&#xD;
    business level, they show up in the Logical Entity Model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An &lt;b>entity&lt;/b> is used to model information and associated behavior that typically must be stored (but this&#xD;
    architectural decision is not made until the logical level model). Entities are used to hold and update information&#xD;
    about some phenomenon, such as an event, a person, or some real-life object. They are usually persistent, having&#xD;
    attributes and relationships needed for a long period, sometimes for the life of the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An entity is usually not specific to one business activity; sometimes, an entity is not even specific to the&amp;nbsp;IT&#xD;
    architecture (or enterprise) itself. The values of its attributes and relationships are often derived from an actor,&#xD;
    perhaps external to the enterprise. An entity may also be needed to help perform internal tasks,and entities can have&#xD;
    complicated behavior. However, unlike other objects, this behavior is strongly related to the phenomenon the entity&#xD;
    represents. Entities are independent of the environment (the actors and activities), but represent the key concepts of&#xD;
    the system being modeled. Typical examples of entities in a bank are &lt;b>Account&lt;/b> and &lt;b>Customer.&lt;/b> In a retail&#xD;
    sales store, examples are&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>Product&lt;/b> and &lt;b>Customer&lt;/b>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Entities provide a point of view from which to understand the system because they show the data structure, which can&#xD;
    help in understanding what the system is supposed to offer its users.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Finding Entities&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Entities represent information in the IT architecture; they are typically used to represent the key concepts the&#xD;
    business activities consume or produce. Entities are frequently passive and persistent. Their main responsibilities are&#xD;
    to persist&amp;nbsp;(store) and manage information in the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A frequent source for finding entities are the Glossary (developed during requirements), the Scope and Context&#xD;
    Diagram,&amp;nbsp;and (descriptions in) the Business Process Model. Look for the nouns and they will likely be entities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Attributes&quot; name=&quot;Attributes&quot;>Attributes&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An &lt;b>attribute&lt;/b> of an entity represents a piece of information about it that is important to know. An attribute has&#xD;
    an attribute type (e.g. &quot;string&quot; or &quot;integer&quot;). Each attribute and attribute type has a name.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An entity normally holds different pieces of information that describe some of its characteristics. Such pieces of&#xD;
    information can either be described implicitly in the textual description of the entity or modeled explicitly as an&#xD;
    attribute of the entity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An attribute is of a certain type. An attribute has a name, preferably a noun that describes the attribute's role in&#xD;
    relation to the entity. An attribute type can be more or less primitive, for example a simple &lt;em>number&lt;/em> or&#xD;
    &lt;em>string&lt;/em>. Different entities can have attributes with identical structures. Those attributes should then share a&#xD;
    description; that is, they should share an attribute type.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>&lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;Using Attributes or Entities&quot; name=&quot;Using Attributes or Entities&quot;>Attributes&amp;nbsp;vs.&#xD;
    Entities&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A key consideration in modeling the entities is always the question: entity or attribute? In other words, is the&#xD;
    &quot;thing&quot; in question important and involved enough to be modeled as an entity, or should it simply be an attribute of&#xD;
    another entity? As always when doing architectures the short answer is &quot;it depends&quot;. It depends, in this case, upon how&#xD;
    the &quot;thing&quot; is used within the IT architecture or enterprise. Is it simply a bit of information or are there other&#xD;
    attributes about the thing that need to be understood and used?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the phenomenon you wish to model is not used by any other entity, you can model it as an attribute of an entity, or&#xD;
    even as a relationship between entities. On the other hand, if the phenomenon is used by any other entity in the model,&#xD;
    or if there are attributes about the phenomenon required, then you must model it as a separate entity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Operations&quot; name=&quot;Operations&quot;>Operations&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To perform a business activity, the&amp;nbsp;actor (or service) uses various Tasks to manipulate business entities. The&#xD;
    actor invokes tasks, or service tasks are invoked,&amp;nbsp;that are part of the business process. These tasks create or&#xD;
    manipulate the business entities by invoking the entity's operations (thinking of the entity as an &quot;object&quot; in the&#xD;
    Object Oriented design sense). Operations are named and may optionally have parameters. This invocation is normally&#xD;
    shown as a message being sent to the object from a Task.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Operations can be defined informally or in detail, depending on the importance or required level of detail. A &quot;more&#xD;
    detailed&quot; description might describe a behavior sequence that tells which attributes and relationships are dealt with&#xD;
    during its performance, how of other objects are contacted, and how it is terminated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;Characteristics of Good Business Entities&quot; name=&quot;Characteristics of Good Business Entities&quot;>Characteristics of a&#xD;
    Good Business Entity&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Its name and description are clear and understandable;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business entity relationships do not depend on each other;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each defined relationship is used in the workflow of at least one activity/task;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All &quot;things&quot; in the business, such as products, documents, contracts, and so on, are modeled as business entities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The entity participates in at least one business activity.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Business Events&quot; name=&quot;Business Events&quot;>Business Events&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business events can be used to notify interested parties (including other business entities) of a change in state of&#xD;
    the business entity. The creation and destruction of a business entity may be significant and result in business&#xD;
    events. If you have defined a state machine for an entity, examine the defined states. Each transition is a potential&#xD;
    business event. Also inspect the attributes and operations of the business entity. Significant operations that are used&#xD;
    infrequently may have a business event associated with them. Changes to important attributes may trigger an event.&#xD;
    Business process patterns and business entity patterns may also provide insight into useful business events. For&#xD;
    example, if a business entity must be approved before being used further, a &lt;i>&amp;lt;something&amp;gt; Approved&lt;/i> business&#xD;
    event may be useful to notify other parties. For more information on finding business events, see &lt;a&#xD;
