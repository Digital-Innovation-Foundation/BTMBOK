    from the software maker’s web site.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Penetration Testing&lt;br />&#xD;
    Security testing in which evaluators mimic real-world attacks in an attempt to identify ways to circumvent the security&#xD;
    features of an application, system, or network. Penetration testing often involves issuing real attacks on real systems&#xD;
    and data, using the same tools and techniques used by actual attackers. Most penetration tests involve looking for&#xD;
    combinations of vulnerabilities on a single system or multiple systems that can be used to gain more access than could&#xD;
    be achieved through a single vulnerability.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Personally Identifiable Information (PII)&lt;br />&#xD;
    Information which can be used to distinguish or trace the identity of an individual (e.g., name, social security&#xD;
    number, biometric records, etc.) alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is&#xD;
    linkable to a specific individual (e.g., date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc.).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Phishing&lt;br />&#xD;
    A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, or access to a larger computerized&#xD;
    system through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a web site. The perpetrator typically masquerades as a&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Privacy&lt;br />&#xD;
    Digital privacy is more than the security of personal information. It also covers the processing of information about&#xD;
    individuals for a business’ operational purposes throughout the information lifecycle (from collection through&#xD;
    disposal) and addressing risks that this processing could create for these individuals. These problems could range from&#xD;
    embarrassment, discrimination, or loss of autonomy to more tangible harms such as identity theft or physical harm.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    R&lt;br />&#xD;

    through an external network (e.g., the Internet).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Risk&lt;br />&#xD;
    The extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event. Risk typically is a function of: (i)&#xD;
    the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence.&#xD;
    Information system-related security risks arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of&#xD;
    information or information systems. These risks reflect the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations&#xD;
    (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the&#xD;
    Nation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Risk Management&lt;br />&#xD;
    The program and supporting processes to manage information security risk to organizational operations (including&#xD;
    mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Risk&#xD;
    management includes: (i) establishing the context for risk-related activities; (ii) assessing risk; (iii) responding to&#xD;
    risk once determined; and (iv) monitoring risk over time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Software that is secretly or surreptitiously installed into an information system to gather information on individuals&#xD;
    or organizations without their knowledge.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    T&lt;br />&#xD;
    Tech Support Scams&lt;br />&#xD;
    A security exploit in which scammers call, place alarming pop-up messages on a computer, offer free “security” scans,&#xD;
    or set up fake websites to convince someone that his/her computer is infected or has a problem. The scammers then ask&#xD;
    to be paid to fix the non-existent problem.11&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Threat&lt;br />&#xD;
