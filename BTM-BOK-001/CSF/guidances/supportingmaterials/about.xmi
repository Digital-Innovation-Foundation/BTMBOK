  <mainDescription>The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), a part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology&#xD;
(NIST), is a collaborative hub where industry organizations, government agencies, and academic institutions work together&#xD;
to address businesses’ most pressing cybersecurity issues. This public-private partnership enables the creation of&#xD;
practical cybersecurity solutions for specific industries, as well as for broad, cross-sector technology challenges.&#xD;
Through consortia under Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), including technology partners—from&#xD;
Fortune 50 market leaders to smaller companies specializing in IT security—the NCCoE applies standards and best practices&#xD;
to develop modular, easily adaptable example cybersecurity solutions using commercially available technology. The NCCoE&#xD;
documents these example solutions in the NIST Special Publication 1800 series, which maps capabilities to the NIST&#xD;
Cybersecurity Framework and details the steps needed for another entity to recreate the example solution. The NCCoE was&#xD;
established in 2012 by NIST in partnership with the State of Maryland and Montgomery County, MD.</mainDescription>
