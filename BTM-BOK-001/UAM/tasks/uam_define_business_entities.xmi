  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task finds and defines the business entities involved in the architecture in question. Related, and very&#xD;
    important, is the definition of standard vocabulary that is used to describe and discuss the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To find candidate business entities, consider what information each business activity and actor&amp;nbsp;works with. The&#xD;
    information that must be queried, validated, created, or communicated is a good starting point. Only significant,&#xD;
    persistent information should be considered as a business entity.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>The business entities identified during this task are high-level, but their definition must be very precise, and agreed by&#xD;
stakeholders. The identification and definition of attributes is optional.</keyConsiderations>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To find candidate business entities, consider what information is created, read, or updated within the associated&#xD;
    business processes.&amp;nbsp;Only significant, persistent information should be considered as a business entity. The&#xD;
    diagram below illustrates this approach by showing the entities involved in a business process:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;img alt=&quot;Process showing Entities involved&quot; src=&quot;resources/EA-Business-Soln-Consulting-Services.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define all business processes and identify where and how business entities participate. The description of the business&#xD;
    entity should include the entity's role in the business,&amp;nbsp;and also&amp;nbsp;its lifecycle from creation to deletion as&#xD;
    illustrated in the defined processes. Other models may also be of use in understanding the business entity (see: &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_diagrams_in_business_pers_F47177D2.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_aVWS0OSYEdy7f9KmjDtwsA&quot;>Guideline: Business Perspective Views&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To show how business entities&amp;nbsp;relate to each other associations are defined (see: ASSOCIATIONS). Give the&#xD;
    associations names that help describe the relationship.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the business level it is not desirable to show whole-part relationships,&amp;nbsp;to&#xD;
    define&amp;nbsp;aggregation-relationships (or other complex relationships such as generalizations). This level of analysis,&#xD;
    for IT architecture definitions, is left to the Logical level. &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Review the workflow of each business process to ensure that business entities have been found, and to verify that the&#xD;
    ones identified do indeed participate in the workflow.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    Review all relationships (only simple associations at the Business level) between business entities. Are the purposes&#xD;
    and semantics of these relationships clear? Determine if these relationships are really necessary to the performance of&#xD;
    the business entity's responsibilities. Also, confirm that the business entity does indeed have all the necessary&#xD;
    relationships required to support the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    Relationships may be derived from examining&amp;nbsp;Process Models ... look for linkages required between entities to&#xD;
    support the process. Business management requirements (i.e. Business Metrics) are also an important source for&#xD;
    requirements for relationships between entities. Also see: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Decide what operations the business entity should have. Base your decisions on the operations of the business entity&#xD;
    within each business process in which it participates. These operations implement&amp;nbsp;the required manipulations for&#xD;
    Business Actors (and Roles) to create, access and modify the business entity. Briefly describe each operation. Explain&#xD;
    how all operations are related, including the business entity's lifecycle if desired.&#xD;

    Identify and briefly describe the attributes of the business entity. Attributes are either properties of the business&#xD;
    entity or any information that it requires to perform its responsibilities that is not another business entity. An item&#xD;
    of information that needs to be determined or calculated (on-demand) must be presented in the form of an operation,&#xD;
    rather than as an attribute of the business entity. Attributes represent persistent properties of the business entity.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    Inspect the Business Entity's operations. Candidate business events include significant changes of state (for example,&#xD;
    an Order that changes from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>received&lt;/em> to &lt;em>process&lt;/em>, or a proposal that changes from&#xD;
    &lt;em>proposed&lt;/em> to &lt;em>accepted&lt;/em>). Operations that trigger these changes of state might also cause these business&#xD;
    events. Also examine what business actors or other business entities should be notified of the business event. Inspect&#xD;
    the business entity's relationships with other business entities. Are there any important changes in these related&#xD;
    entities of which the business entity should be notified?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    This is an optional, but very useful aspect for the Business Entity Model. The most important thing is to capture a&#xD;
    clear picture of the business entities, their relationships to other entities, and&amp;nbsp;optionally important attributes&#xD;
    and operations.&#xD;
