    Conduct means personal behaviour based on moral principles. Professionalism is the skill, good judgment, and polite
    behaviour that is expected from a person who is trained to do a job well.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>INDEPENDENCE&lt;/strong>: staff conduct, and decision-making should be determined by the need to serve the
    common good and public interest, and never by any other interests whether private or as a result of, for example,
    political pressure.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>IMPARTIALITY&lt;/strong>: staff members should be unbiased in any decisions they are called upon to make.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>OBJECTIVITY&lt;/strong>: any conclusions drawn by staff as part of the project work should be balanced and based
    on a thorough analysis of the facts and legal background.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>LOYALTY&lt;/strong>: loyalty towards the organisation is essential for maintaining its independence and
    achieving its objectives. It is also necessary for the functioning of each service. Putting these principles into
    practice requires:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>CIRCUMSPECTION&lt;/strong>: which is about stopping and reflecting on the possible consequences and implications
    of potential actions, showing a degree of moderation and a sense of proportion and propriety.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>RESPONSIBILITY&lt;/strong>: which is about carrying out those tasks entrusted to you as dutifully as possible
    and looking for solutions when difficulties are encountered. It is also important to know and respect the legal
    obligations and administrative rules and procedures in force. The key principles can be summarised as
    &lt;strong>INTEGRITY&lt;/strong>, which means consistently adhering to ethical principles and making sound decisions based on
    them. In addition to the aforementioned code of ethics, every practitioner of the PM² Project Management Methodology
    should act based on the following values:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>LAWFULNESS&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>ACCOUNTABILITY&lt;/strong>: act in accordance with the law and hold yourself
    accountable for decisions and acts.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>FAIRNESS&lt;/strong>: fairness is our duty to make decisions impartially and objectively, and free from
    self-interest, prejudice and favouritism.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>NON-DISCRIMINATION&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>EQUAL TREATMENT&lt;/strong>: respect the principle of non-discrimination
    and, in particular, guarantee equal treatment for members of the public irrespective of nationality, gender, racial or
    ethnic origin, religion or beliefs, disability, age or sexual orientation.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>PROPORTIONALITY&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>CONSISTENCY&lt;/strong>: ensure that measures taken are proportional to the
    aim pursued and be consistent in your behaviour.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>RESPECT&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>LEADERSHIP&lt;/strong>: exercise the power of your position with responsibility and
    promote ethical principles and professional conduct by leadership and example.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>HONESTY&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>OPENESS&lt;/strong>: declare any private interests and openly provide reasons for
    any decision.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>TEAMWORK&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>CONFLICT RESOLUTON&lt;/strong>: work together to achieve common goals by finding
    solutions through better mutual understanding.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    • &lt;strong>POLITENESS&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>CLEAR COMMUNICATION&lt;/strong>: engage colleagues by showing respect and
    encouraging efficiency through clarity of instructions.
