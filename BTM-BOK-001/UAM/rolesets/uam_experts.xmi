  <mainDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Roles__Experts&quot; name=&quot;XE_Roles__Experts&quot;>&lt;/a>The IT architecture typically models the future state of the&#xD;
business, from a technology perspective. Where does technology need to go within the enterprise in order to properly&#xD;
support the business? This demands a very good understanding of the business; a level of understanding that can only be&#xD;
attained from business experts. These experts know the portion of the business being modeled, but hopefully also understand&#xD;
where the business and its processes are going in the future. This knowledge must then be married with an in-depth&#xD;
knowledge of IT technologies, how they support the business and how they can support the future business. This is the job&#xD;
of the IT architects: to take all this information and synthesize a model of the future state of the business.&lt;a&#xD;
