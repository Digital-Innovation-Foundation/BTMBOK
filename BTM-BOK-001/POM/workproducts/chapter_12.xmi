    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Dr. Tamara A. Johnson, Assistant Chancellor for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion at University of Wisconsin-Eau&#xD;
    Claire&lt;br />&#xD;
    Dr. Tamara Johnson’s role as assistant chancellor for equity, diversity, and inclusion at the University of&#xD;
    Wisconsin-Eau Claire involves supervising and collaborating with various campus entities to ensure their operations&#xD;
    continue to support the university’s initiatives to foster diversity and equity within the university community. Dr.&#xD;
    Johnson oversees the Affirmative Action, Blugold Beginnings (pre-college program), Gender and Sexuality Resource&#xD;
    Center, Office of Multicultural Affairs, Ronald E. McNair Program, Services for Students with Disabilities, Student&#xD;
    Support Services, University Police, and Upward Bound units and leads campus-wide initiatives to educate and train&#xD;
    faculty, students, and staff about cultural awareness, diversity, and institutional equity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Dr. Johnson’s journey to her current role began more than 20 years ago when she worked as a counselor for the Office of&#xD;
    Multicultural Student Affairs at the University of Illinois. Her role in this office launched her on a path through&#xD;
    university service—Dr. Johnson went on to work as the associate director for University Career Services at Illinois&#xD;
    State University, the director for multicultural student affairs at Northwestern University, and the director for&#xD;
    faculty diversity initiatives at the University of Chicago. As faculty at the Chicago School of Professional&#xD;
    Psychology, Argosy University, and Northwestern University, Dr. Johnson taught counseling courses at the undergraduate,&#xD;
    master’s, and doctorate levels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Dr. Johnson’s work at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire involves developing a program and protocols to ensure all&#xD;
    faculty and staff across the institution receive baseline diversity training. In addition, one of her goals is to&#xD;
    include criteria related to diversity factors in the evaluations of all faculty/staff. A primary issue that she seeks&#xD;
    to address is to increase the awareness of the challenges experienced by underrepresented students. This includes&#xD;
    individuals who may come from backgrounds of low income, students of color, first-generation students, and other&#xD;
    marginalized groups such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students. Dr. Johnson understands the importance of&#xD;
    creating initiatives to support individuals in those groups so their specific concerns may be addressed in multiple&#xD;
    ways. As you will learn in this chapter, when leaders proactively create an inclusive and supportive climate that&#xD;
    values diversity, benefits are produced that result in in positive outcomes for organizations.&#xD;
