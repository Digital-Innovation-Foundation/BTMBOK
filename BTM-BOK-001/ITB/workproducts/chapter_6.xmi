    Management and Leadership in Today's Organizations&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What is the role of management?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the four types of planning?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the primary functions of managers in organizing activities?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do leadership styles influence a corporate culture?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do organizations control activities?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What roles do managers take on in different organizational settings?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What set of managerial skills is necessary for managerial success?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What trends will affect management in the future?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Today’s companies rely on managers to guide daily operations using human, technological, financial, and other resources&#xD;
    to create a competitive advantage. For many beginning business students, being in “management” is an attractive but&#xD;
    somewhat vague future goal. This vagueness is due in part to an incomplete understanding of what managers do and how&#xD;
    they contribute to organizational success or failure. This chapter introduces the basic functions of management and the&#xD;
    skills managers need to drive an organization toward its goals. We will also discuss how leadership styles influence a&#xD;
    corporate culture and highlight the trends that are shaping the future role of managers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Jalem Getz&lt;br />&#xD;
    BuyCostumes.com/Wantable, Inc.&lt;br />&#xD;
    You might ask, “How does one come to work in the world of online costume retail?” A passion for holiday make-believe&#xD;
    and dress-up? A keen eye for business potential? The drive to capitalize on a competitive advantage? If you’re Jalem&#xD;
    Getz, the answer is: all of these. Getz is the founder of BuyCostumes.com, an online costume and accessories retailer&#xD;
    and, most recently, founder of Wantable, Inc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As with most businesses, BuyCostumes.com and Wantable, Inc., are the result of careful planning. BuyCostumes.com was a&#xD;
    response to what Getz saw as inherent flaws of resource allocation with the business model of brick-and-mortar costume&#xD;
    retailers. “As a brick-and-mortar business, we were the gypsies of retail, which caused scale problems since we started&#xD;
    over every year. Because we only were in a mall four or five months a year, locations we had one year often were rented&#xD;
    the next. So we had to find new stores to rent each year. Then we had to find management to run the stores, and train&#xD;
    employees to staff them. We also had to shuffle the inventory around each year to stock them. It’s almost impossible to&#xD;
    grow a business like that.” By turning to the internet, however, Getz was able to bypass all of those issues. The&#xD;
    virtual “space” was available year-round, and inventory and staff were centralized in a single warehouse location.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Getz grew BuyCostumes.com to a multimillion-dollar business before selling it, with a staff of about 600 employees&#xD;
    during its peak season. Before Getz sold the business, it carried over 10,000 Halloween items and had upwards of 20&#xD;
    million visitors each holiday season. In one year, it shipped over 1 million costumes across the world, including 45&#xD;
    countries outside the United States. “We say that our goal is to ensure that anytime anyone buys a costume anywhere in&#xD;
    the world, it will be from BuyCostumes.com. And, although to some extent we’re kidding, we’re also very serious.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To keep track of all this action, Getz mixed ideals of a strong work ethic, a willingness to take risks, and an&#xD;
    interest in having fun while making a profit. Given the size of the company, BuyCostumes.com organized its management&#xD;
    to help keep the company focused on the corporate goal of continued growth. For Getz, his role in the management&#xD;
    hierarchy was to “hire excellent people who have similar goals and who are motivated the same way I am and then put&#xD;
    them in a position where they can succeed.” Beyond that? “Inspect what you expect.” This maxim is a concise way to say&#xD;
    that, although he does not believe in constantly watching over his employees’ shoulders, he does believe in&#xD;
    periodically checking in with them to ensure that both he and they are on the same page. By considering the process of&#xD;
    management a conversation between himself and his employees, he exhibits a strong participative leadership style.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Getz will joke that he wishes he could say that he spent his childhood dreaming of the day he could work with costumes.&#xD;
    The truth, though, is that he saw an opportunity, grabbed it, and hasn’t let go since. And sometimes, especially during&#xD;
    Halloween, truth can be even more satisfying than fiction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After selling BuyCostumes.com, Getz experimented with other digital start-ups but quickly realized he worked best with&#xD;
    retail. In 2012, he launched Wantable, Inc., an online personal shopping service. In its first four years, Getz led the&#xD;
    company to exceed 28,000% annual revenue growth and to hire more than 100 employees. It became profitable in 2016 and&#xD;
    looked to double its income the following year.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
