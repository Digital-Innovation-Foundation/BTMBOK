    Overview&lt;br />&#xD;
    This online learning page explores the uses and benefits of the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure&#xD;
    Cybersecurity(&quot;The Framework&quot;) and builds upon the knowledge in the Components of the Framework page.&amp;nbsp; This page&#xD;
    describes reasons for using the Framework, provides examples of how industry has used the Framework, and highlights&#xD;
    several Framework use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Why Use the Cybersecurity Framework?&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Framework provides a common language and systematic methodology for managing cybersecurity risk. The Core includes&#xD;
    activities to be incorporated in a cybersecurity program that can be tailored to meet any organization’s needs.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    The Framework is designed to complement, not replace, an organization's cybersecurity program and risk management&#xD;
    processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process of creating Framework Profiles provides organizations with an opportunity to identify areas where existing&#xD;
    processes may be strengthened, or where new processes can be implemented.&amp;nbsp; These Profiles, when paired with the&#xD;
    Framework's easy-to-understand language, allows for stronger communication throughout the organization.&amp;nbsp; The&#xD;
    pairing of Framework Profiles with an implementation plan allows an organization to take full advantage of the&#xD;
    Framework by enabling cost-effective prioritization and communication of improvement activities among organizational&#xD;
    stakeholders, or for setting expectations with suppliers and partners.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, Profiles and associated&#xD;
    implementation plans can be leveraged as strong artifacts for demonstrating due care.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Implementation Tiers component of the Framework can assist organizations by providing context on how an&#xD;
    organization views cybersecurity risk management.&amp;nbsp; The Tiers guide organizations to consider the appropriate level&#xD;
    of rigor for their cybersecurity program.&amp;nbsp; The Tiers may be leveraged as a communication tool to discuss mission&#xD;
    priority, risk appetite, and budget.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Supporting Risk Management with the Framework&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Framework helps guide key decision points about risk management activities through the various levels of an&#xD;
    organization from senior executives, to business and process level, and implementation and operations as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As pictured in the Figure 2 of the Framework, the diagram and explanation demonstrates how the Framework enables&#xD;
    end-to-end risk management communications across an organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The executive level communicates the mission priorities, available resources, and overall risk tolerance to the&#xD;
    business/process level. The business/process level uses the information as inputs into the risk management process, and&#xD;
    then formulates a profile to coordinate implementation/operation activities. The implementation/operations level&#xD;
    communicates the Profile implementation progress to the business/process level. The business/process level uses this&#xD;
    information to perform an impact assessment. Business/process level management reports the outcomes of that impact&#xD;
    assessment to the executive level to inform the organization’s overall risk management process and to the&#xD;
    implementation/operations level for awareness of business impact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Who should use the Framework?&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Cybersecurity Framework is for organizations of all sizes, sectors, and maturities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While the Framework was designed with Critical Infrastructure (CI) in mind, it is extremely versatile.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With built-in customization mechanisms (i.e., Tiers, Profiles, and Core all can be modified), the Framework can be&#xD;
    customized for use by any type of&amp;nbsp; organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because the Framework is outcome driven and does not mandate how an organization must achieve those outcomes, it&#xD;
    enables scalability.&amp;nbsp; A small organization with a low cybersecurity budget, or a large corporation with a big&#xD;
    budget, are each able to approach the outcome in a way that is feasible for them. It is this flexibility that allows&#xD;
    the Framework to be used by organizations which are just getting started in establishing a cybersecurity program, while&#xD;
    also providing value to organizations with&amp;nbsp; mature programs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    How are other organizations using the Framework?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Over the past few years NIST has been observing how the community has been using the Framework. These are some common&#xD;
    patterns that we have seen emerge:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Leadership has picked up the vocabulary of the Framework and is able to have informed conversations about cybersecurity&#xD;
    risk.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Organizations have used the tiers to determine optimal levels of risk management.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Organizations are finding the process of creating profiles extremely effective in understanding the current&#xD;
    cybersecurity practices in their business environment.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Profiles and implementation plans are being leveraged in prioritizing and budgeting for cybersecurity improvement&#xD;
    activities.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Examples from organization's using the Framework&lt;br />&#xD;
    Many organizations are using the Framework in a number of diverse ways, taking advantage of its voluntary and flexible&#xD;
    nature. The section below provides a high-level overview of how two organizations have chosen to use the Framework, and&#xD;
    offers insight into their perceived benefits.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To see more about how organizations have used the Framework, see Framework Success Stories and Resources.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NIST is always interested in hearing how other organizations are using the Cybersecurity Framework. Organizations are&#xD;
    encouraged to share their experiences with the Cybersecurity Framework using the Success Stories page.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    University of Chicago&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The University of Chicago's Biological Sciences Division (BSD) Success Story is one example of how industry has used&#xD;
    the Framework.&amp;nbsp; BSD selected the Cybersecurity Framework to assist in organizing and aligning their information&#xD;
    security program across many BSD departments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    BSD began with assessing their current state of cybersecurity operations across their departments.&amp;nbsp; This consisted&#xD;
    of identifying business priorities and compliance requirements, and reviewing existing policies and practices.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    This information was documented in a Current State Profile.&amp;nbsp; BSD then conducted a risk assessment which was used&#xD;
    as an input to create a Target State Profile.&amp;nbsp; This Profile defined goals for the BSD cybersecurity program and&#xD;
    was aligned to the Framework Subcategories.&amp;nbsp; Finally, BSD determined the gaps between the Current State and Target&#xD;
    State Profiles to inform the creation of a roadmap.&amp;nbsp; The roadmap consisted of prioritized action plans to close&#xD;
    gaps and improve their cybersecurity risk posture. The roadmap was then able to be used to establish budgets and align&#xD;
    activities across BSD's many departments. The image below represents BSD's approach for using the Framework.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
    After implementing the Framework, BSD claimed that &quot;each department has gained an understanding of BSD’s cybersecurity&#xD;
    goals and how these may be attained in a cost-effective manner over the span of the next few years.&quot;&amp;nbsp; BSD also&#xD;
    noted that the Framework helped foster information sharing across their organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    BSD recognized that another important benefit of the Cybersecurity Framework, is the ease in which it can support many&#xD;
    individual departments with differing cybersecurity requirements. BSD said that &quot;since the framework outcomes can be&#xD;
    achieved through individual department activities, rather than through prescriptive and rigid steps, each department is&#xD;
    able to tailor their approach based on their specific departmental needs.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    the University of Chicago: An Education Case Study.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Intel&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Intel used the Cybersecurity Framework in a pilot project to communicate cybersecurity risk with senior leadership, to&#xD;
    improve risk management processes, and to enhance their processes for setting security priorities and the budgets&#xD;
    associated with those improvement activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because the Framework is voluntary and flexible, Intel chose to tailor the Framework slightly to better align with&#xD;
    their business needs. Intel modified the Framework tiers to set more specific criteria for measurement of their pilot&#xD;
    security program by adding People, Processes, Technology, and Environment to the Tier structure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The graphic below represents the People Focus Area of Intel's updated Tiers.&amp;nbsp; There are 3 additional focus areas&#xD;
    included in the full case study.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In addition to modifying the Tiers, Intel chose to alter the Core to better match their business environment and needs.&#xD;
    For example, they modified to the Categories and Subcategories by adding a Threat Intelligence Category.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After the slight alterations to better fit Intel's business environment, they initiated a four-phase process for their&#xD;
    Framework use.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Intel began by establishing target scores at a category level, then assessed their pilot department in key functional&#xD;
    areas for each category such as Policy, Network, and Data Protection.&amp;nbsp; These scores were used to create a&#xD;
    heatmap.&amp;nbsp; An illustrative heatmap is pictured below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The resulting heatmap was used to prioritize the resolution of key issues and to inform budgeting for improvement&#xD;
    activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After using the Framework, Intel stated that &quot;the Framework can provide value to even the largest organizations and has&#xD;
    the potential to transform cybersecurity on a global scale by accelerating cybersecurity best practices&quot;.&amp;nbsp; They&#xD;
    found the internal discussions that occurred during Profile creation to be one of the most impactful parts about the&#xD;
    implementation.&amp;nbsp; These conversations &quot;helped facilitate agreement between stakeholders and leadership on risk&#xD;
    tolerance and other strategic risk management issues&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
