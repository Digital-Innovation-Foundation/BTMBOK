  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) is one of NIST’s six research laboratories that focuses on IT measurements,&#xD;
    testing, and standards, and is a globally recognized and trusted source of high-quality, independent, and unbiased&#xD;
    research and data. As a world-class measurement and testing laboratory encompassing a wide range of areas of computer&#xD;
    science, mathematics, statistics, and systems engineering, ITL’s research program supports NIST’s mission to promote&#xD;
    U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and related technology.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    ITL’s strategy is to maximize the benefits of information technology (IT) to society through a balanced IT measurement&#xD;
    science and standards portfolio of three major activities: 1) fundamental research in mathematics, statistics, and IT;&#xD;
    2) applied IT research and development; and 3) standards development and technology transfer. ITL has identified five&#xD;
    priority areas through which ITL research will maximize the benefits of IT and metrology to society: 1) cybersecurity,&#xD;
    2) the Internet of Things, 3) artificial intelligence, 4) reliable computing, and 5) future computing technologies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    ITL works with industry and other agencies to develop IT standards through standards developing organizations (SDOs)&#xD;
    and has been accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a standards developer since October&#xD;
    1984. ITL maintains a list of its present participation in voluntary standards activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    ITL Mission&lt;br />&#xD;
    As one of the major research components of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Information&#xD;
    Technology Laboratory (ITL) has the broad mission to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by&#xD;
    advancing measurement science, standards, and technology through research and development in information technology,&#xD;
    mathematics, and statistics.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    ITL Purpose&lt;br />&#xD;
    TL’s purpose is to cultivate trust in IT and metrology.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    ITL has the broad mission to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science,&#xD;
    standards, and technology through research and development in information technology, mathematics, and statistics. ITL&#xD;
    identifies emerging and high-priority technologies, conducts path-breaking research to advance our understanding of&#xD;
    their capabilities and potential applications, and develops security solutions that have a high impact on the U.S.&#xD;
    critical infrastructures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
