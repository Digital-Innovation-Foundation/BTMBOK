    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is often confusion regarding the usage and specific meaning of user, role, and actor. UAM defines and clarifies&#xD;
    these concepts. An actor aggregates (perhaps multiple) roles which are “interfaces” to the system, and an actor can be&#xD;
    associated with multiple physical people.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To understand the business, its activities and tasks one must understand who the business interacts with; that is, who&#xD;
    puts demands on it, or is interested in its output. The different interactions are executed by and represented as&#xD;
    actors, with a role defining a set of related skills, competencies, and responsibilities required to perform the&#xD;
    associated activity. Roles are associated with and defined by the specific business activities and tasks with which&#xD;
    they interact. Therefore a role is equated to the business behavior or activities, and by extension the&#xD;
    responsibilities, of the role as it interacts with the system. An actor can assume multiple roles. The&#xD;
    figure&amp;nbsp;below clarifies the relationship between users (i.e., physical people, and other systems, that interact&#xD;
    with activities), actors and roles in relation to the activities and tasks within the system. The definitions and&#xD;
    relationships are slightly different than the UML and RUP&amp;nbsp; definitions. Actors are very similar to UML and RUP;&#xD;
    however the concept and usage of role is expanded and clarified along with their relationship to actors and users.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>&lt;u>Note&lt;/u>:&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;Roles are &lt;em>&lt;strong>not&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> defined at the business level—they are&#xD;
        define in the Logical Perspective. This is because roles imply a decision regarding the implementation of the&#xD;
        associated activity (i.e., manual, user, or automated). These decisions are &lt;em>only&lt;/em> made at the Logical&#xD;
        level. Therefore only Actors are defined, but roles defined at the Logical level may be added to the Business Roles&#xD;
        Model if desired.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Roles vs. Actors&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following types of business users are examples of potential business &lt;em>actors&lt;/em>:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Customers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Suppliers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Partners&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Information Suppliers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Local authorities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Employees.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Hence, an actor is associated with a human user. However, there are situations where, for instance, an information&#xD;
    system&amp;nbsp;is an actor. An actor represents an external&amp;nbsp;interaction with the system rather than necessarily a&#xD;
    real physical user.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The actors defined above, on the other hand, may interact with multiple business activities. The following are examples&#xD;
    of potential business activities for a &lt;em>customer&lt;/em> actor:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Purchase&lt;/strong> - purchase a product from the enterprise&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Support&lt;/strong> - get support for a purchased product from the enterprise&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A single&amp;nbsp;physical user of a business, equated to&amp;nbsp;an &lt;em>actor&lt;/em>, may interact with multiple business&#xD;
    activities; for example a &quot;customer&quot; may interact with the &quot;purchase&quot; business activity or the &quot;support&quot; activity.&#xD;
    Also, the same physical user can&amp;nbsp;be several different actors with the system, for example a person acting as a&#xD;
    &quot;customer&quot; at one point may act as a &quot;supplier&quot; at another point. This means that one and the same person can embody&#xD;
    instances of different actors—and different physical people may&amp;nbsp;interact with&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;organization as the&#xD;
    same actor.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A role defines a set of related skills, competencies, and responsibilities (defined by the activities that they are&#xD;
    associated with). Roles are associated with business processes or tasks (i.e., Business Activities, see &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/whitepapers/uam_bpmn_intro_tutorial_426154F6.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_gYTbgN2MEdyVUKFKTmaZUA&quot;>Whitepaper: BPMN - an Introductory Tutorial&lt;/a> )&amp;nbsp;to specify who performs these&#xD;
    activities, and by inference the&amp;nbsp;set of business entities they consume and produce. Therefore a &lt;em>business&lt;/em>&#xD;
    &lt;em>role&lt;/em>, which is used in the Business Model, is&amp;nbsp;equated to the business-level behavior (and by extension&#xD;
    the responsibilities) of an actor that interacts with the system.&amp;nbsp;Also see: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Role&lt;/a>, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/termdefinitions/uam_context-role_B9C4F862.html&quot;&#xD;

    Definition: Functional Role&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is no simple user-to-actor and actor-to-role analysis, as illustrated in the figure below. The same actor with&#xD;
    the system may be assumed by multiple users (people) and vice versa, and actors may assume multiple roles during their&#xD;
    interaction with the business. Analysis of these interactions must be done in order to categorize them into the various&#xD;
    actors and roles. The benefit of this analysis is a better understanding of the required user interface and the&#xD;
    possible simplification of the user interface defined at the Logical and Technical Perspectives to support the various&#xD;
    users. Also, analysis of access control requirements for users can be performed resulting in the definition of&#xD;
    roles-based access controls (at the logical and technical levels). Note that some roles (i.e., the interfaces) may&#xD;
    never be defined and implemented, if for example the activity is automated, however the role may still be used for&#xD;
    roles-based access control purposes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    People (or other systems) that interact with the system are users that are associated with the actors that interact&#xD;
    with the system (through roles). A single user may also be different actors with the system at different times. Actors&#xD;
    define (or collect) a set of roles that the person may assume in relation to the system (or enterprise), with a role&#xD;
    being closely associated with the activities that they interact with and the required competencies and&#xD;
    privileges.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This set of relationships is illustrated below where &amp;lt;user a&amp;gt; interacts with the system as a Manager actor, and&#xD;
    &amp;lt;user b&amp;gt; interacts with the system as&amp;nbsp;Manager and Employee actors:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Users, Actors and Roles&quot; src=&quot;./resources/Role-vs-Actor-employee.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The figure below precisely defines these user-actor-role relationships using UML notation:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;img alt=&quot;User - Actor - Role relationships defined using UML&quot; src=&quot;./resources/Role-vs-Actor-uml.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An example, at the logical level, of actors and roles is shown below. Typically identified roles&amp;nbsp;are &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/termdefinitions/uam_context-role_B9C4F862.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_1lsiQPvGEeOyDIZvZjuaLg&quot;>Contextual Role&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;defined as verbs, however there may be contexts where business&#xD;
    functions are being modeled (or other circumstances), and therefore &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/termdefinitions/uam_func-role_668447D2.html&quot; guid=&quot;_8Uq7sPvGEeOyDIZvZjuaLg&quot;>Functional&#xD;
    Role&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;are defined.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Users - Actors and Roles at the Logical Level&quot; src=&quot;./resources/Role-vs-Actor-customer.png&quot; />&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An actor&amp;nbsp;should be given a name that reflects its&amp;nbsp;interaction with&amp;nbsp;the business—the business service&#xD;
    that it interacts with, similar to the names suggested above. The name should be a noun and be applicable to any&#xD;
    person—or any information system—playing the part of the actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;How to Name Business Actors&quot; name=&quot;How to Name Business Actors&quot;>How to Name&amp;nbsp;Roles&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A&amp;nbsp;role&amp;nbsp;should be given a name that reflects its&amp;nbsp;specific business activity interaction, similar to the&#xD;
    names suggested above. The name should be a verb for contextual roles and nouns for functional roles, and reflect to&#xD;
    responsibilities of the activity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are no specific characteristics that an actor should cover, however roles are associated in the model with&#xD;
    activities with the implication that there are knowledge and skills required. The following characteristics are of use&#xD;
    when describing roles:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prior knowledge and experience;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Job, tasks, and skills requirements;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cognitive characteristics.&#xD;
