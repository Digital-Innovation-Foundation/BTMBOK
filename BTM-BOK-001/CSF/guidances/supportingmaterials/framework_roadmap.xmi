    Overview&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Introduction to the Framework Roadmap learning module seeks to inform readers about what the Roadmap is, how it&#xD;
    relates to the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (&quot;The Framework&quot;), and what the Roadmap&#xD;
    Areas are.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Introduction to the Roadmap&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Roadmap is a companion document to the Cybersecurity Framework. The Roadmap, while not exhaustive in describing all&#xD;
    planned activities within NIST, identifies key activities planned for improving and enhancing the Cybersecurity&#xD;
    Framework. These activities may be carried out by NIST in conjunction with private and public sector organizations â€“ or&#xD;
    by those organizations independently. While the Roadmap is focused on activities around the Cybersecurity Framework,&#xD;
    the results of work described in the Roadmap are expected to be useful to a broader audience to improve cybersecurity&#xD;
    risk management.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Roadmap Areas for Development&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Roadmap continues to evolve with the Cybersecurity Framework. Roadmap Version 1.1 identifies 14 high-priority areas&#xD;
    for development, alignment, and collaboration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The 14 areas are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Confidence Mechanisms&lt;br />&#xD;
    Cyber-Attack Lifecycle&lt;br />&#xD;
    Cybersecurity Workforce&lt;br />&#xD;
    Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management&lt;br />&#xD;
    Federal Agency Cybersecurity Alignment&lt;br />&#xD;
    Governance and Enterprise Risk Management&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identity Management&lt;br />&#xD;
    International Aspects, Impacts, and Alignment&lt;br />&#xD;
    Measuring Cybersecurity&lt;br />&#xD;
    Privacy Engineering&lt;br />&#xD;
    Referencing Techniques&lt;br />&#xD;
    Small Business Awareness and Resources&lt;br />&#xD;
    Internet of Things (IoT)&lt;br />&#xD;
    Secure Software Development&lt;br />&#xD;
    More information regarding each of these areas is included within the Roadmap located at Framework - Related Efforts.&#xD;
