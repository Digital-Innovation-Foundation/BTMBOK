    Framework Components&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Cybersecurity Framework consists of three main components:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Framework Core&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Implementation Tiers&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Profiles&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    ramework Core&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Core is a set of desired cybersecurity activities and outcomes organized into Categories and aligned to Informative&#xD;
    References.&amp;nbsp; The Framework Core is designed to be intuitive and to act as a translation layer to enable&#xD;
    communication between multi-disciplinary teams by using simplistic and non-technical language. The Core consists of&#xD;
    three parts: Functions, Categories, and Subcategories. The Core includes five high level functions: Identify, Protect,&#xD;
    Detect, Respond, and Recover.&amp;nbsp; These 5 functions are not only applicable to cybersecurity risk management, but&#xD;
    also to risk management at large.&amp;nbsp; The next level down is the 23 Categories that are split across the five&#xD;
    Functions.&amp;nbsp; The image below depicts the Framework Core's Functions and Categories.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The Categories were designed to cover the breadth of cybersecurity objectives for an organization, while not being&#xD;
    overly detailed.&amp;nbsp; It covers topics across cyber, physical, and personnel, with a focus on business outcomes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Subcategories are the deepest level of abstraction in the Core.&amp;nbsp; There are 108 Subcategories, which are&#xD;
    outcome-driven statements that provide considerations for creating or improving a cybersecurity program. Because the&#xD;
    Framework is outcome driven and does not mandate how an organization must achieve those outcomes, it enables risk-based&#xD;
    implementations that are customized to the organization's needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The five Subcategories pictured from the Business Environment Category (ID.BE) provide an example of the outcome&#xD;
    focused statements that are found throughout the core.&amp;nbsp; The column to the right, Informative References support&#xD;
    the Core by providing broad references that are more technical than the Framework itself.&amp;nbsp; Organizations may wish&#xD;
    to use some, none, or all of these references to inform the activities to undertake to achieve the outcome described in&#xD;
    the Subcategory.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For more information regarding the Informative References, see the Informative References Learning Module.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Framework Implementation Tiers&lt;br />&#xD;
    Tiers describe the degree to which an organization’s cybersecurity risk management practices exhibit the&#xD;
    characteristics defined in the Framework. The Tiers range from Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4) and describe an&#xD;
    increasing degree of rigor, and how well integrated cybersecurity risk decisions are into broader risk decisions, and&#xD;
    the degree to which the organization shares and receives cybersecurity info from external parties.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tiers do not necessarily represent maturity levels. Organizations should determine the desired Tier, ensuring that the&#xD;
    selected level meets organizational goals, reduces cybersecurity risk to levels acceptable to the organization, and is&#xD;
    feasible to implement, fiscally and otherwise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Framework Profiles&lt;br />&#xD;
    Profiles are an organization's unique alignment of their organizational requirements and objectives, risk appetite, and&#xD;
    resources against the desired outcomes of the Framework Core.&amp;nbsp; Profiles can be used to identify opportunities for&#xD;
    improving cybersecurity posture by comparing a “Current” Profile with a “Target” Profile.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Profiles are about optimizing the Cybersecurity Framework to best serve the organization. The Framework is voluntary,&#xD;
    so there is no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ way to do it. One way of approaching profiles is for an organization to map their&#xD;
    cybersecurity requirements, mission objectives, and operating methodologies, along with current practices against the&#xD;
    subcategories of the Framework Core to create a Current-State Profile.&amp;nbsp; These requirements and objectives can be&#xD;
    compared against the current operating state of the organization to gain an understanding of the gaps between the two.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The creation of these profiles, and the gap analysis allows organizations to create a prioritized implementation plan.&#xD;
    The priority, size of gap, and estimated cost of the corrective actions help organizations plan and budget for&#xD;
    cybersecurity improvement activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
