    This workflow defines the generic Capability Pattern used to create an enterprise level (EA), or business&amp;nbsp;domain&#xD;
    level (BD), or any other level of IT architecture. There are several paths through this workflow, the path that you&#xD;
    choose depends on the purpose of your architecture effort, as well as the stage of the architecture effort. The&#xD;
    possible paths through the UAM &quot;Capability Pattern&quot; are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Use Architecture&lt;/strong> – IT architecture deliverables are used to analyze the current or future&#xD;
        architecture, to develop migration plans, to develop training materials and to consult with various stakeholders&#xD;
        (i.e. providing guidance and advice, reviewing models for correctness, or for the initial development of plans);&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Define&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Architecture&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>[Simple]&lt;/strong> – when time or resources are tight&#xD;
        this path can be chosen. Things are simplified and existing information is leveraged in order to make this activity&#xD;
        practical and useful.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Define&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Architecture [&lt;/strong>&lt;strong>Existing] –&lt;/strong> Often existing systems and&#xD;
        services have not been defined in an architectural fashion, which creates problems when one needs to understand how&#xD;
        they fit into a larger enterprise or domain context. This activity uses an approach similar to the “Simple&#xD;
        Architecture” activity to create this architecture definition.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Define&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Architecture&lt;/strong> [&lt;strong>Moderate] or [Complex]&lt;/strong> – this should be the&#xD;
        normal path when defining an IT architecture. On a moderately sized architecture effort with multiple locations,&#xD;
        moderately complex interactions with other systems, and where the automation level is somewhat known, it may be&#xD;
        cost-effective to combine the Logical and Technology Perspectives for architecture maintenance purposes. The&#xD;
        process of arriving at the architecture is the same, but the logical models are not maintained once the technology&#xD;
        models are developed. This means that the technology models must continue to include the fully manual tasks. It is&#xD;
        however necessary to have a business level view for this size of architecture effort for communication purposes.&#xD;
        This business level is a valuable tool for illustrating the impact of technology and re-engineering choices to&#xD;
        management. It also serves to elaborate on the scope of the architecture effort in terms of the internal business&#xD;
        operation. Three levels or views of the architecture are defined: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>Define Business Models&lt;/strong> – this usual starting point describes the target architecture from&#xD;
                the business perspective and using business language. Concepts of processing and technology are absent.&#xD;
                This equates to the Computational Independent Model (CIM) using MDA terminology, or the “Scope” and&#xD;
                “Business Model” levels in the Zachman Framework and DoDAF.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>Define Logical Models&lt;/strong> – this level introduces computational aspects into the models,&#xD;
                concepts such as “server” and “storage” at the logical level. More detail is generally provided along with&#xD;
                relationships between components. This equates to the Processing Independent Model (PIM) in MDA, or the&#xD;
                “System Model” in the Zachman Framework and DoDAF.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>Define Technology Models&lt;/strong> – This equates to the Processing Specific Model (PSM) in MDA, or&#xD;
                the “Technology Model” in the Zachman Framework and DoDAF.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Architecture&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Review&lt;/strong> – When architectures are completed a peer review is done to&#xD;
        ensure completeness, consistency and comprehension among other things. Enterprise architectures would be reviewed&#xD;
        by Domain architects, Domain architects would review Project architectures, etc. Business and domain experts would&#xD;
        also be involved to ensure the IT architecture accurately captures the &quot;system&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Architecture Decision&lt;/strong> – a number of significant decisions are continuously being made regarding&#xD;
        the approach, patterns or technologies to be used within an architecture. This activity manages these decisions in&#xD;
        a way that they can be publicized, reused or re–examined as needed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Start Architecture Project&lt;/strong> – in order to get the IT architecture project off on the right foot,&#xD;
        this explicit step is defined.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Maintain Architecture&lt;/strong> - IT architectures will be much more useful over time if they are&#xD;
        maintained. A whole set of activities are defined to do this.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    UAM also defines the set of Tasks, deliverables (Work Products) and the &quot;Delivery Process&quot; for creating architectures&#xD;
    along with a generic governance process (See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Governance&lt;/a>). There is also an extensive set of examples provided that use the templates and other resources&#xD;
    included, providing a practical grounding in what information to capture and how it is presented in models, summaries&#xD;
    and reports, and other artifacts (See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../UAM/customcategories/uam_guidance_B4D6E38.html&quot; guid=&quot;_LREWsNZzEdyTWqLy4FSCdg&quot;>Guidance&lt;/a>). There are&#xD;
    many participants involved in the development of IT architectures; see: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>IT architecture is mandatory in any organization with more than 100 employees. System and&amp;nbsp;processes and people are all&#xD;
networked together in multiple ways in order to support the goals of the enterprise. This connectivity cannot be&#xD;
understood, optimized, implemented and managed properly without the creation of abstract models. These models support the&#xD;
decision making required to define, implement and evolve the enterprise's information technology that in turn supports the&#xD;
goals of the organization.</usageGuidance>
    <purpose>&lt;a id=&quot;XE_Capability_Pattern__Overview&quot; name=&quot;XE_Capability_Pattern__Overview&quot;>&lt;/a>This workflow is followed to create an&#xD;
IT architecture as defined by UAM. There are specific paths defined for the various activities involved in creating, using&#xD;
and maintaining an IT architecture.</purpose>
    <usageNotes>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following decisions should be made regarding the&amp;nbsp;UAM IT Architecture discipline's workflow:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide how to perform the workflow by looking at the activities in this workflow. Study the process&#xD;
        diagram&amp;nbsp;and the guidelines. Decide which activities to perform and in which order. The&amp;nbsp;provided &lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../UAM/deliveryprocesses/uam_it_architecture_del_8B27C350.html&quot;&#xD;

        these process within the enterprise and how to proceed;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide when, during the project lifecycle or business planning lifecycle, to introduce each part of this workflow.&#xD;
        The enterprises' project planning and management milestones dictate the need for architectural reviews for example.&#xD;
        On the other hand, Architectural Decisions may need to be defined at any time. Also see:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../UAM/guidances/roadmaps/uam_ad_governance_D3C747FE.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_0TknkGjpEeS7ieerwXbTqg&quot;>Roadmap: AD Governance&lt;/a> and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../UAM/guidances/roadmaps/uam_governance_60575AE0.html&quot; guid=&quot;_p0Js0OCrEdynr9jlfK-aMA&quot;>Roadmap:&#xD;
        Governance&lt;/a>;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide what parts of the architecture activities to perform based upon the scope, context, and objectives.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide on the appropriate set of participants for the process.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following parts can be performed relatively independently from other IT architecture projects (with the assumption&#xD;
    that an IT architecture is already defined is some cases):&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;table title=&quot;Independent Activities&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot; summary=&quot;Workflow usage&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;>&#xD;

                &lt;strong>Define a Simple Architecture&lt;/strong>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                If the context and scope is simple, time is at a premium, and existing documentation exists, then this&#xD;
                simple approach can be used.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>Review an Architecture&lt;/strong>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Architectural reviews may be done independently of other activities and projects.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;

                &lt;strong>Document an Existing Architecture&lt;/strong>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                A project may need to do this prior to defining its own architecture, or this may be done independently in&#xD;
                support of some other activity.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;

                This activity may be performed at any time, within the context of a project or independent of a project.&#xD;

    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity is focused on organizing and doing&amp;nbsp;reviews of&amp;nbsp;the Business, Logical or&#xD;
    Technical&amp;nbsp;Perspective of the IT architecture. Appropriate materials are gathered, venues booked and participants&#xD;
    informed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT architecture review is done in two phases, the first&amp;nbsp;focuses on the generated architecture, ensuring that&#xD;
    it is complete and consistent, which is normally an&amp;nbsp;IT architect&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>peer&lt;/em>&#xD;
    &lt;em>review&lt;/em>.&amp;nbsp;Typically, once an architecture view&amp;nbsp;is completed, this peer review is done prior to moving&#xD;
    on to next steps; this is, therefore,&amp;nbsp;the last step in finalizing a&amp;nbsp;view within the Perspective (i.e. a set&#xD;
    of models, the process models for example). See for example:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    These activities are best carried out by a small team staffed by cross-functional team members. The team&#xD;
    should&amp;nbsp;include members with domain experience who can identify key abstractions, and ideally system and technical&#xD;
    level IT architects and experts. The team should also have experience and knowledge of a wide range of technologies&#xD;
    along with&amp;nbsp;model organization and layering.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the most important yet surprisingly often neglected aspects of reviews is the management to resolution of the&#xD;
    follow-up tasks or actions identified during the review. While you can usually resolve many of the identified&#xD;
    issues&amp;nbsp;during the course of the review meeting itself, be prepared to assign tasks as needed but ensure that the&#xD;
    workload of team members is balanced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that even if you can review everything you need to in a single meeting, you probably won't get approval of all&#xD;
    your conclusions the first time. Be prepared to carry out subsequent reviews as necessary to help manage the&#xD;
    undertaking of a large number of follow-up tasks.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    This analysis assumes that the IT architecture is complete and accurate (i.e. these &lt;em>reviews&lt;/em> have been&#xD;
    completed) and essentially takes a step back from the IT architecture and looks at the larger context, proposed&#xD;
    solutions, implications of these solutions, and how it all fits into the enterprise's business strategy, IT strategy,&#xD;
    technology and other standards,&amp;nbsp;and other plans and objectives. This analysis is slightly different for each of&#xD;
    the levels. Not only are the participants different, the focus and objectives of the analysis at the Business level are&#xD;
    much different that those at the Technical level.&#xD;

    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objective of this activity is to understand the new or changed technology and then assess its impacts and&#xD;
    opportunities&amp;nbsp;if used in the existing IT architecture. The&amp;nbsp;first&amp;nbsp;step of this analysis is to define the&#xD;
    level of impact:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business&lt;/strong> - new business opportunities are available, or enhanced services or processes at the&#xD;
        business level are possible;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Logical&lt;/strong> - the new technology does not have business process or services implications, but does&#xD;
        have large implications on the current IT architecture, which would have to be revised starting at the Logical&#xD;
        level;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Technical&lt;/strong> - the new technology does not have significant architectural implications; it is a&#xD;
        direct substitute for existing technology, but with benefits.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the level of impact has been determined then the next step is to do a more thorough analysis of the business&#xD;
    opportunities, and to&amp;nbsp;make a &lt;em>go&lt;/em> or &lt;em>no-go&lt;/em> decision — to decide if further action is needed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This further action to be done depends on the level of impact, but usually involves:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business level&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;- analyzing a new business opportunity, or enhanced services or processes,&#xD;
        from a cost-benefit perspective including IT architecture impacts;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Logical&lt;/strong> - analyzing impacts on the current IT architecture and any benefits that the new&#xD;
        technology provides, including a cost-benefit analysis;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Technical&lt;/strong> - analyzing the new technology's&amp;nbsp;impacts on the existing IT architecture and any&#xD;
        derived benefits, including a cost-benefit analysis.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Architectural Decisions are used to capture and track all of this analysis.&#xD;

    A new technology has been identified and this activity examines its&amp;nbsp;possible use within the system or enterprise.&#xD;
    This activity examines the new technology, defines possible uses, and then defines its possible&amp;nbsp;impacts on the&#xD;
    existing IT architecture. These impacts may be at the Business level (e.g. new business opportunity), Logical level&#xD;
    (e.g. a greatly revised IT architecture is needed) or the Technical level (e.g. the new technology is a simple&#xD;
    substitute for existing technology, but with benefits). Finally, after some business-level analysis, a&amp;nbsp;decision is&#xD;
    made on whether or not to proceed with further work.&#xD;

    The architectural assessment done in&amp;nbsp;this context involves ensuring that the architecture addresses the business&#xD;
    need and fits in with the enterprise direction in the long-term. Scenarios may be used to test the architecture. If&#xD;
    there is a problem in the direction taken by the architecture in terms of the enterprise long-term objectives or&#xD;
    strategies then management will need to be made aware of and bless this deviation in direction.&#xD;

    Note that even if you can review everything you need to in a single meeting, you probably won't get approval of all&#xD;
