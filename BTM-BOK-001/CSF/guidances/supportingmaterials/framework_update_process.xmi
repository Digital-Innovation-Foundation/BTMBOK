    Update Process&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST routinely engages industry through three primary activities. First, NIST continually and regularly engages in&#xD;
    community outreach activities by attending and participating in meetings, events, and roundtable dialogs. Second, NIST&#xD;
    solicits direct feedback from industry through requests for information (RFI), requests for comments (RFC), and through&#xD;
    the NIST Framework team’s email (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:cyberframework@nist.gov&quot;>cyberframework@nist.gov&lt;/a>). Finally, NIST&#xD;
    observes and monitors relevant resources and references - including descriptions of Framework use - published by&#xD;
    government, academia, and industry.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As described in Figure 1, below, NIST catalogs all comments and feature enhancements received on the Framework in a&#xD;
    Features List. NIST then categorizes all comments and feature enhancement suggestions on the Features Lists as either&#xD;
    Major, Minor, or Administrative comments based on the degree to which implementing the change would impact&#xD;
    compatibility with prior versions of the Framework. The features are also prioritized based on their perceived&#xD;
    importance to stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The Framework is a living document and is intended to be updated based on industry feedback and recommendations as well&#xD;
    as NIST’s continued goal to inform the community. The Features List aides NIST in properly tracking, adjudicating, and&#xD;
    incorporate comments into updates as appropriate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Update Process Flow&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Framework update process integrates the NIST Cybersecurity Risk Management Conference into a public-private dialog&#xD;
    that asks stakeholders every three years:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is it an appropriate time for an update, and if so&lt;br />&#xD;
    What would you like to see in that update (Figure 2)?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Stakeholder input helps NIST determine whether an update is warranted and what type of update is needed (major, minor,&#xD;
    administrative).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    If NIST learns that industry is not prepared for a new update, or sufficient features have not been identified to&#xD;
    warrant an update, NIST continues to collect comments and suggestions for feature enhancement, bringing those topics to&#xD;
    the annual Cybersecurity Risk Management Conference for discussion, until such a time that an update is warranted&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the Framework stakeholders believe an update is needed, NIST discerns the type of update required and creates a&#xD;
    Draft Framework Update. The Draft Framework Update is published before the annual Cybersecurity Risk Management&#xD;
    conference. During the conference, NIST establishes tracks to allow conference participants an opportunity comment on&#xD;
    the proposed draft.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With stakeholder disposition understood from the most recent conference, NIST then publishes a final version of the&#xD;
    Framework.&amp;nbsp; This process repeats over time to refine, clarify, and enhance the Framework.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
