    We collaborate with experts from industry, government, and academia.&lt;br />&#xD;
    The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) invites you to participate in a variety of opportunities at the&#xD;
    center as a key player, building and deploying standards-based cybersecurity example solutions. You can suggest or help&#xD;
    define problems for us to address, support the development of reference designs, and test them in real-world&#xD;
    environments. We encourage feedback on our practice guides from users, integrators, and others interested in deploying&#xD;
    our example solutions. Download our stakeholders brochure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    If you have an intractable cybersecurity problem, or ideas or components for an example solution, we’d like to hear&#xD;
    from you. Or contact us to share your ideas for projects, use cases, or workshops.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    VENDORS&lt;br />&#xD;

    Work with us in our labs. You can contribute your expertise, hardware, or software to the reference design for a&#xD;
    specific problem. Sign up for alerts from us, and watch the Federal Register for calls for participation. Vendors that&#xD;
    participate with resources are required to sign Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). See an example&#xD;
    CRADA here.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    REFERENCE DESIGN USERS&lt;br />&#xD;

    Deploy one of our example solutions, then provide feedback to help us validate and improve it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    INTEGRATORS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Gear&lt;br />&#xD;
    You can help companies implement our reference designs in real-world environments and provide feedback to help make&#xD;
    them more easily deployable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY EXCELLENCE PARTNERS&lt;br />&#xD;
