    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Why is it important to understand and appreciate the importance of international management in today’s world?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What is culture, and how can culture be understood through Hofstede’s cultural framework?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How are regions of the world categorized using the GLOBE framework, and how does this categorization enhance&#xD;
    understanding of cross-cultural leadership?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why is an understanding of cultural stereotyping important, and what can students do to prepare for cultural&#xD;
    stereotyping by looking at social institutions?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What steps can you undertake to be better prepared for cross-cultural assignments?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the main strategies that companies can use to go international?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why might it be necessary for a company to go international, and how might it accomplish this goal?&lt;br />&#xD;
    The above example shows that Domino’s has successfully managed global challenges to become successful internationally.&#xD;
    For many business leaders over the past few decades, the business world was becoming “flat” because barriers to trade&#xD;
    were slowly disappearing. The expectation was that soon global companies would operate unconstrained by national&#xD;
    borders. However, recent trends suggest that the business world is now seeing a barrage of protectionism and&#xD;
    nationalism as many countries and their leaders emphasize the negatives of globalization. Consider that the U.K. is&#xD;
    currently experiencing the Brexit negotiations and a potential exit from the European Union. The European Union has&#xD;
    provided the means to the U.K. to freely trade with a number of other European countries without hindrance. At the same&#xD;
    time, rhetoric about policies and practices to protect local industries against global competition and to protect local&#xD;
    jobs is increasing. But does this mean globalization is dead? Far from it—experts have analyzed recent trade data and&#xD;
    shown that globalization is actually strengthening. The DHL Global Connected Index, which tracks the flow of capital,&#xD;
    information, trade, and human resources, indicates that the degree of globalization continues to rise.1 This finding&#xD;
    suggests that any serious management scholar will need to be aware of the importance of international management and&#xD;
    the need to be able to adapt practices to ensure that management of global operations goes smoothly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    No company is immune to the forces of globalization. Whether you run a small company based in Wisconsin or manage a&#xD;
    Fortune 500 company, you are affected by global forces. You may compete with firms from China or India, have coworkers&#xD;
    from Egypt, Brazil, or Germany, or have to negotiate with someone from Russia. This chapter will prepare you for the&#xD;
    complexities of international management by discussing some of the crucial issues faced by managers of international&#xD;
    companies today. The chapter begins by discussing some of the key factors in making the business world global today and&#xD;
    why an understanding of international management is so critical. The chapter then explores the importance of national&#xD;
    cultures because cross-cultural conflicts can make an international business difficult to navigate and manage. By&#xD;
    understanding the countries and the cultures they find themselves in, international managers can better prepare to deal&#xD;
    with such differences, including appropriate preparation for cross-cultural assignments, preferred leadership styles&#xD;
    around the world, and the potential for stereotyping.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The chapter concludes with coverage about the various approaches to taking a company international, the advantages and&#xD;
    disadvantages of each approach, and the types of business strategies available to companies in the international arena.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Mike Schlater, Domino’s Pizza&lt;br />&#xD;
    Domino’s Pizza has more than 14,000 stores worldwide. As executive vice president of Domino’s Pizza’s international&#xD;
    division, Mike Schlater is president of Domino’s Canada with more than 440 stores. Originally from Ohio, Schlater&#xD;
    started his career with Domino’s as a pizza delivery driver and worked his way up into management. Schlater saved his&#xD;
    earnings, and with some help from his brother, he was able to accept the opportunity to have the first international&#xD;
    Domino’s franchise in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1983. Within weeks, Schlater’s store in Canada reached higher sales than&#xD;
    his previous store in Ohio had ever attained.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However, it was not an easy start. Schlater faced a number of challenges going international. First, he had to identify&#xD;
    the international suppliers and get them approved to sell their products to Domino’s. This shows one of the challenges&#xD;
    that organizations face when entering new global markets. To meet quality standards designed to protect a brand,&#xD;
    companies must undertake an extensive review of potential new suppliers to ensure consistent product quality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Second, as discussed in this chapter, a major challenge when opening a business on foreign soil is negotiating the&#xD;
    political, cultural, and economic differences of that country. Domino’s relies on local master franchisees to take&#xD;
    advantage of their local expertise in dealing with marketing strategies, political and regulatory issues, and the local&#xD;
    labor market. The master franchisees of Domino’s Pizza’s international business are individuals or entities who, under&#xD;
    a specific licensing agreement with Domino’s, control all operations within a specific country. Such master franchisees&#xD;
    have deep local knowledge that helped Domino’s succeed. For example, it takes local experience to know that only 30&#xD;
    percent of the people in Poland have phones, so carryout needs to be the focus of the business; that Turkey has changed&#xD;
    its street names three times in the past 30 years, so delivery is much more challenging; or that, in Japanese, there is&#xD;
    no word for pepperoni, the most popular topping worldwide. These are just a few of the challenges that Domino’s has had&#xD;
    to overcome on the road to becoming the worldwide leader in the pizza delivery business. Under the leadership of people&#xD;
    like Schlater, and with the help of dedicated, local master franchisees, Domino’s has been able to not only compete in,&#xD;
    but lead the global pizza delivery market.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Such an impressive career path might seem like luck to some, but Schlater achieved his success due to determination and&#xD;
    attention to detail. Additionally, despite such success, Schlater has been socially responsible. Consider that Schlater&#xD;
    recently won $250,000 in a lottery. Since Schlater believes in philanthropy, he donated the entire amount to Cardinal&#xD;
    Carter High School in his hometown. Over the years, Schlater has donated millions of dollars to foundations and&#xD;
    charities, such as the London Health Sciences Foundation, because he now has the ability to indulge after spending&#xD;
    decades climbing the corporate ladder at Domino’s Pizza. Such charitable focus has also shone light on his socially&#xD;
    responsible tendencies, another critical aspect of success.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Schlater is now president of Domino’s of Canada, Ltd., which operates more than 440 stores located in every province,&#xD;
    as well as the Yukon and Northwest Territories.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
