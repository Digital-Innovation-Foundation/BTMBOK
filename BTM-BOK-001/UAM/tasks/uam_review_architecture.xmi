    The newly created architecture is reviewed from these and other perspectives:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To uncover any unknown or perceived risks in the architecture;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To detect any architectural design flaws;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To detect a potential mismatch between the requirements and the architecture: over-design, unrealistic&#xD;
        requirements, or missing requirements. In particular aspects&amp;nbsp;in the areas of operation, administration and&#xD;
        maintenance are often neglected;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To evaluate one or more specific architectural qualities: performance, reliability, flexibility, security, safety;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To identify reuse opportunities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once this stakeholder review is completed, the perspective is completed and the next level may be defined if desired.&#xD;
    The completed perspective is also now ready for inclusion in the normal enterprise IT management processes that&#xD;
    &lt;em>use&lt;/em> the architecture deliverables, which is&amp;nbsp;generically outlined in: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Seen from 20,000 feet there is not much that distinguishes an IT architecture review from any other assessment or&#xD;
    review. However, one important characteristic of IT architecture is the lack of specific measurements for many&#xD;
    architectural quality attributes—only a few architectural qualities can be objectively measured. Performance is an&#xD;
    example where measurement is possible. Other qualities are more qualitative or subjective: conceptual integrity for&#xD;
    example. Moreover, it is often hard to decide what a metric means in absence of other data or reference for comparison.&#xD;
    If a reference architecture is available and understood by the target audience, it is often convenient to express some&#xD;
    of the results of the review &lt;b>relative&lt;/b> to this reference system. This may happen in a context where the system&#xD;
    under design can be compared to an earlier design.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    When in the life-cycle this review takes place also affects its purpose or usefulness. Architectural reviews are&#xD;
    normally done at the completion of an architectural development iteration, such as when a first iteration of the&#xD;
    business level view of the architecture has been completed. Catching problems early has many benefits, and therefore&#xD;
    performing an assessment after each iteration is beneficial. These review points are defined with the UAM processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Leadership, maturity, pragmatism, and result-orientation are important to to a good IT architecture review—a reviewer&#xD;
    may uncover architectural defects that are likely to be unpopular if they threaten the schedule of a project. Still,&#xD;
    it's better to raise critical issues early, when they can be resolved, rather than blindly following a schedule that&#xD;
    leads the project team down the wrong path. The architecture reviewer needs to balance risks against costs, remaining&#xD;
    sensitive to the broader issues of enterprise or business domain success. The architecture reviewer also needs to be a&#xD;
    persuasive communicator who can raise and discuss sensitive issues.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3 align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Peer Reviews&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Peer Reviews involve higher (or peer) level authorities, for example a domain architecture would be reviewed by the&#xD;
    enterprise's &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../UAM/roles/uam_enterprise_architect_D157E74C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_0yThIMIaEdyMpOiGFnM_WA&quot;>Enterprise Architect&lt;/a>. Enterprise level architectures would be reviewed by a set of&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../UAM/roles/uam_domain_architect_7C8A9B01.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_YrJ-UMIcEdyMpOiGFnM_WA&quot;>Business Line or Domain Architect&lt;/a>. IT architectures are also reviewed by strict&#xD;
    peers: Project IT Architects or Business Domain architects reviewing each other's work for example.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    A peer review focuses on the following aspects of the IT architecture:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            Match between the scope, context, and IT architecture Project Plan, with the resulting IT architecture;&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            Overall structure of the defined architecture;&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            Completeness of the architecture and individual models;&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            Conformance of the architecture with enterprise standards (ADs etc.), objectives, plans&amp;nbsp;and strategies.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    The objective is to ensure the IT architecture definition meets enterprise standards in terms of quality,&#xD;
    structure&amp;nbsp;and completeness, independent of the details defined within the architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3 align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Stakeholder Review&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Stakeholder reviews delve deep into the content of the IT architecture with all stakeholders participating, namely&#xD;
    technical stakeholder (IT experts and technical managers) and business stakeholders (i.e. business experts and business&#xD;
    managers). This is the traditional view of an architecture (or design) review, where stakeholders provide feedback on&#xD;
    the models.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Therefore a stakeholder review focuses on the following aspects of the IT architecture:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            Accuracy, in terms of capturing the business processes, technical solutions,&amp;nbsp;and other elements;&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            Structure and relationships within the architecture in both business terms and technical terms;&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            Practicalities in terms of operational considerations, skills, etc. (i.e., business level practicalities);&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            Practicalities in terms of implementability, migration, technologies, etc. (i.e., technical practicalities);&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
            Other considerations such as IT security.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;h3>&#xD;
    General&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following general approach is used to do the review:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Entities and Locations&lt;/strong> - review the architectural representation of the system and question its&#xD;
        structure, components and definitions. It may also be compared to similar and existing structures and&#xD;
        architectures. Peers also bring their knowledge and experience to the review, which is often invaluable. Step&#xD;
        through two of the four aspects to start: Entity Models and Location Models;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Scenarios&lt;/strong> - walk through busy scenarios (Process Models and Roles Models)&amp;nbsp;to ensure that the&#xD;
        architecture addresses the business needs, and to also&amp;nbsp;identify possible non-functional problem areas.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Previous steps produced a representation of the architecture (i.e. the Business or Logical Perspectives), therefore&#xD;
    question and reason based on this representation&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Entities and Locations&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Starting with these aspects will ease participants into the architecture definition. A basic understanding of these&#xD;
    elements helps in bringing all participants onto the same level in terms of definitions, and also in terms of the scope&#xD;
    of the IT architecture. Relatively simple models and definitions are reviewed, to ensure accuracy and&#xD;
    conformance.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Scenarios&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is the systematic review of process scenarios described by the architecture (at any of the three levels: Business,&#xD;
    Logical or Technical). The models must support all required business activity. Non-functional aspects (e.g. the loading&#xD;
    on a server) may arise and be discussed. These should be noted and explored with peers and stakeholders, and solutions&#xD;
    agreed, or the issued noted for further action.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The advantage of such an approach is that it puts the task in a very concrete perspective, understandable by all&#xD;
    parties. It also allows&amp;nbsp;for probing into omissions or flaws into the requirements, especially when the&#xD;
    requirements are informal or unwritten or very general and terse.&amp;nbsp;In other words, important scenarios are used to&#xD;
    test the defined architecture, keeping in mind all the important aspects to be reviewed (i.e. completeness,&#xD;
    consistency, etc.). Also part of this review are the how&amp;nbsp;Entities are involved and how Actors and Roles&#xD;
    participate in the processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Identifying Issues&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Uncovering potential issues is mostly done by human judgment based upon knowledge and experience. This knowledge and&#xD;
    experience includes such things as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Common failure patterns repeated from project to project;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Heuristics used to uncover problem areas;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business or technical knowledge;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Check-lists can be useful;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Results from previous reviews.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Capture potential issues as they appear, describing them in a neutral tone. Ensure these descriptions are agreed by all&#xD;
    and recorded in the Review Record, and if needed prioritize them. After the meetings, refine the definitions of&#xD;
    their&amp;nbsp;scope and impact. If there are many, tackle them in priority order.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be possible to identify possible solutions to issues at the review meetings. If so record these results in the&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../UAM/workproducts/uam_review_record_B5C8210C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_ON-wgPIOEdyIELoltz1wKA&quot;>Artifact: Architecture Review Record&lt;/a> as well.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    After the review, allocate responsibility for each issues identified in the Review Record. &quot;Responsibility&quot; in this&#xD;
    case may not be to fix the issue, but to coordinate additional investigation of alternatives, or to coordinate the&#xD;
    resolution of the issue if it is far-reaching or broad in scope.&#xD;

  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An architectural review has one of two objectives. The two types of review are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Peer Review&lt;/strong> - ensuring that&amp;nbsp;the IT architecture is&amp;nbsp;complete and consistent (usually done&#xD;
        first, prior to a stakeholder review);&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Stakeholder Review&lt;/strong> - the IT architecture is reviewed to ensure it accurately models the system&#xD;
        (i.e. experts and other stakeholder review).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first type of review is focused on ensuring the models are clear, and complete. The participants are technical and&#xD;
    typically peers of the IT architect that created the IT architecture under review. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../UAM/tasks/uam_assess_architecture_5CF00CAD.html&quot; guid=&quot;_WbMKgMg1EdyBSO6dC2FdkA&quot;>Task: Assess the&#xD;
    Architecture&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The second type of review, defined here,&amp;nbsp;is focused on the content to ensure it captures the business and that it&#xD;
    meets the requirements as defined by stakeholder (both business and technical), therefore there are various experts&#xD;
    involved (i.e. business, but more technical experts at the Logical and Technical levels) along with the other&#xD;
    stakeholders for the IT architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
