  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) is initiating the development of practices to ease the&#xD;
    migration from the current set of public-key cryptographic algorithms to replacement algorithms that are resistant to&#xD;
    quantum computer-based attacks. These practices will take the form of white papers, playbooks, and demonstrable&#xD;
    implementations for organizations—in particular, cryptographic developers and implementers. This effort complements the&#xD;
    NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization activities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What is the Challenge?&lt;br />&#xD;
    The discovery of new cryptographic weaknesses or advances in the technologies supporting cryptanalysis often leads to&#xD;
    the need to replace a legacy cryptographic algorithm. The advent of quantum computing technology will compromise many&#xD;
    of the current cryptographic algorithms, especially public-key cryptography, which is widely used to protect digital&#xD;
    information. Algorithm replacement can be extremely disruptive and often takes decades to accomplish. The replacement&#xD;
    of algorithms generally requires:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identifying the presence of the legacy algorithms&lt;br />&#xD;
    Understanding the data formats and application programming interfaces of cryptographic libraries to support necessary&#xD;
    changes and replacements&lt;br />&#xD;
    Developing implementation validation tools&lt;br />&#xD;
    Discovering the hardware that implements or accelerates algorithm performance&lt;br />&#xD;
    Determining operating system and applications code that uses the algorithm&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identifying all communications devices with vulnerable protocols&lt;br />&#xD;
    Updating the processes and procedures of developers, implementers, and users&lt;br />&#xD;
    The new algorithms will likely not be drop-in replacement, and they may not have the same performance or reliability&#xD;
    characteristics as legacy algorithms due to differences in characteristics, such as key size, signature size, error&#xD;
    handling properties, number of execution steps required to perform the algorithm, and key establishment process&#xD;
    complexity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the replacement algorithms are selected, other operational considerations to accelerate adoption and&#xD;
    implementation across the organization include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developing a risk-based approach that takes into consideration security requirements, business operations, and mission&#xD;
    impact&lt;br />&#xD;
    Establishing a communication plan to be used both within the organization and with external customers and&#xD;
    partners&lt;br />&#xD;
    Identifying a migration timeline and the necessary resources&lt;br />&#xD;
    Updating or replacing security standards, procedures, and recommended practice documentation&lt;br />&#xD;
    Providing installation, configuration, and administration documentation&lt;br />&#xD;
    Testing and validating the new processes and procedures&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why is this important?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Cryptographic technologies are used throughout government and industry to protect the confidentiality and integrity of&#xD;
    information at rest or in transit. Cryptographic algorithms are fundamental to these cryptographic technologies. With&#xD;
    the advances in quantum computing technologies, public-key cryptographic algorithms can be compromised and no longer&#xD;
    provide the security protection intended by their designers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These algorithms are implemented in computers, mobile devices, storage, and network components that are deployed&#xD;
    worldwide. Some algorithms require secret keys that are shared by originators and recipients of information, such as&#xD;
    the Advanced Encryption Algorithm (AES). Other algorithms, such as RSA, use a private key held by one party to an&#xD;
    exchange and a public key held by other parties to the exchange. Most cryptographic integrity and key establishment&#xD;
    functions use public-key cryptography. Unfortunately, once practical quantum computing becomes available to cyber&#xD;
    adversaries, attacks based on a process known as Shor’s algorithm will render ineffective all public-key cryptographic&#xD;
    algorithms currently in widespread use.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What does this mean to me and my organization?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Access to practical quantum computers is uncertain at this time. However, once access becomes available, all public-key&#xD;
    algorithms and associated protocols will be vulnerable to criminals, competitors, and other adversaries. These&#xD;
    individuals can record and capture current information and communications and gain access to the raw content once&#xD;
    quantum computing technology is available. This includes all recorded communications and stored information protected&#xD;
    by those public-key algorithms. In addition to compromising the confidentiality of the information, the integrity of&#xD;
    the information cannot be assured. As a result, it is critical to begin planning for the replacement of hardware,&#xD;
    software, and services that use public-key algorithms now so that the information is protected from future attacks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work on post-quantum cryptographic standards and implementing guidelines is well underway. However, experience has&#xD;
    shown that, in the best case, 5 to 15 or more years following the publication of quantum-resistant public-key&#xD;
    cryptographic standards will still be required to implement those standards to replace most of the vulnerable&#xD;
    public-key systems currently in use. This best case scenario assumes that significant implementation planning is&#xD;
    initiated prior to the publication of post-quantum standards. Organizations can and should begin to plan and prepare&#xD;
    for this transition now so that they are ready to adopt and implement the new algorithms at the end of the&#xD;
    standardization process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What is NIST doing to meet this challenge?&lt;br />&#xD;
    As reflected in NIST’s April 2016 NISTIR 8105, Report on Post-Quantum Cryptography, work on the development of&#xD;
    quantum-resistant public key cryptographic standards is underway, and the algorithm selection process is well in-hand,&#xD;
    with algorithm selection expected to be completed in the next 1 to 2 years (&lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography&quot;>https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To complement the ongoing effort, the NCCoE is initiating a campaign to bring awareness to the issues involved in&#xD;
    migrating to post-quantum algorithms and develop white papers, playbooks, and proof-of-concept implementations. NIST&#xD;
    has developed a draft cybersecurity white paper, Getting Ready for Post-Quantum Cryptography&amp;nbsp; to start the&#xD;
    discussion. In addition, the NCCoE is forming a Cryptographic Applications community of interest to work on a migration&#xD;
    playbook that would address the challenges previously described and provide recommended practices to prepare for a&#xD;
    smooth cryptographic migration. Finally, findings from these activities and future workshops will drive the NCCoE’s&#xD;
    development of practical, demonstrable implementations in collaboration with the community.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will host an Invitational Virtual Workshop on Considerations&#xD;
    in Migrating to Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms on August 24, 2020.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We invite your participation in the Applied Cryptography - PQC community of interest as well as your suggestions&#xD;
    regarding workshops and other near-term activities. Please join the community of interest by sending an email to &lt;a&#xD;
