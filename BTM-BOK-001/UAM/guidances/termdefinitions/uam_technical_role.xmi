  <mainDescription>A Technical Role represents the interfaces that interact with the activities and processes of the system, and may be&#xD;
internal or external. They are equated to or defined by the activities (and by extension the responsibilities) that it&#xD;
interacts with in the system. At the technical level all of the analysis was done and all actors and roles and their&#xD;
structure and relationships are defined. Organizational positions (or external systems) were also equated to actors and&#xD;
roles, and this along with their relationships to activities and processes provides the complete picture for the required&#xD;
interface, including security aspects (RBAC).&lt;br />&#xD;
