    In cloud environments, workloads are constantly being spun up, scaled out, moved around, and shut down. Organizations&#xD;
    often find adopting cloud technologies is not a good business proposition because they encounter security and privacy&#xD;
    issues, such as the inability to maintain consistent protections across platforms, dictate how different information is&#xD;
    protected, and have visibility into how information is protected to ensure compliance with requirements. Many&#xD;
    organizations face additional challenges because security and privacy laws vary around the world, and the dynamic&#xD;
    nature of cloud means that workloads may silently move from one jurisdiction to another. The NCCoE has developed two&#xD;
    trusted cloud projects and supported resources that are dedicated to helping solve these challenges.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Hardware Enabled Security for the Server Platform - A Layered Approach to Platform Security by Leveraging Hardware&#xD;
    Security Mechanisms for Cloud and Edge Computing Use Cases&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In todayâ€™s cloud data centers and edge computing, attack surfaces have significantly increased, hacking has become&#xD;
    industrialized, and most security control implementations are not coherent or consistent. The foundation to any data&#xD;
    center or edge computing security strategy should be securing the platform on which data and workloads will be executed&#xD;
    and accessed. The physical platform represents the first layer for any layered security approach and provides initial&#xD;
    protections to help ensure higher-layer security controls can be trusted. This white paper explains hardware-based&#xD;
    security techniques and technologies that can improve platform security and data protection for cloud data centers and&#xD;
    edge computing.&#xD;

    NISTIR 7904 Trusted Geolocation in the Cloud: Proof of Concept Implementation&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This publication explains selected security challenges involving Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing&#xD;
    technologies and geolocation. It then describes a proof of concept implementation that was designed to address those&#xD;
    challenges. The publication provides sufficient details about the proof of concept implementation so that organizations&#xD;
    can reproduce it if desired. The publication is intended to be a blueprint or template that can be used by the general&#xD;
    security community to validate and implement the described proof of concept implementation.&#xD;
