    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Lauri Goodman Lampson, Planning Design Research Corporation&lt;br />&#xD;
    Lauri Goodman Lampson is president and CEO of Planning Design Research Corporation,1 a firm that analyzes work&#xD;
    environments to understand how employees work and what kind of spaces and facilities they need to do their best, most&#xD;
    productive work. Lampson was hired by Accenture, a consulting firm, to evaluate and improve its location in Houston.&#xD;
    Accenture’s Houston office was a three-story, 66,000-square-foot building that served 800 employees.2 Accenture&#xD;
    employees are consultants themselves, and they typically spend up to two-thirds of their working time away from the&#xD;
    office serving clients.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Lampson worked with Accenture director of workplaces Dan Johnson and Steelcase, an office furniture manufacturer, to&#xD;
    study how Accenture was using its Houston space. Lampson’s “focus is on gaining a deep understanding of the business&#xD;
    and its strategy for success and then developing strategic workplace solutions that enable those goals.&quot;3 To achieve&#xD;
    this outcome, Lampson and Steelcase analyzed employee demographics and expectations and studied how employees actually&#xD;
    interacted with each other and performed tasks in the workplace. Accenture wanted to have a workspace that fostered its&#xD;
    corporate goals of: worker innovation, collaboration, and flexibility.4&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Understanding a firm’s strengths is an important step in strategic analysis, and Lampson’s focus on supporting those&#xD;
    strengths in the workplace environment led to Workplace 2.0, Accenture’s reimagined facility. Not only does the new&#xD;
    workspace provide better physical and technological support for collaboration among Accenture employees, but Lampson&#xD;
    and Steelcase were able to identify opportunities for Accenture to significantly reduce the size of its offices.&#xD;
    Accenture saves money by using less space (it was able to downsize to a single floor of 25,000 square feet to serve the&#xD;
    same number of workers) and supports worker interaction and engagement by providing a more effective workspace. You can&#xD;
