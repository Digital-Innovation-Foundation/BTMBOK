  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task defines, at the technical level, the locations involved in the architecture in question. As in real-estate,&#xD;
    locations are very important to any business in terms of the business processes and tasks that are supported at each&#xD;
    type of location. This model defines the deployment of hardware and software systems and services to the locations,&#xD;
    which in turn defines many other factors and requirements, such as cost, network topography and bandwidths, deployment&#xD;
    of servers, storage and other infrastructure services, among many others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Locations Model is used, along with input from stakeholders and IT experts, to define and refine the&#xD;
    Technical Locations Model.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

Process Model&lt;/a>, define the technical level view of the system's locations. Detail included in this view includes the&#xD;
activities and processes (i.e. business services) supported at the location, therefore the Technical Process Model needs to&#xD;
be created and consulted as well as the Logical Process Model.</sectionDescription>

    Using the Logical Process Model, the&amp;nbsp;Business Process Model and other sources of information, determine the&#xD;
    services and facilities required between the locations. This includes both business level services&amp;nbsp;such as &quot;access&#xD;
    to products and services&quot; or infrastructure services such as &quot;email&quot; and &quot;telephone&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt&quot;>&#xD;
    The objective of this step is to define the technical level view of services provided and required between locations,&#xD;
    which will influence technical design choices, especially network aspects. Network technical options are explored and&#xD;
    decisions made regarding the technology to be used for the Local Area Network (LAN) at the location, and the Wide Area&#xD;
    Network (WAN) or Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) supporting communications between locations. The segmentation of the&#xD;
    network is also defined, in terms of &quot;domains&quot; and &quot;zones&quot; as defined in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    documented in Architectural Decisions (ADs), regarding the technologies to be used for network segmentation as well&#xD;
    as&amp;nbsp;LAN, WAN and MAN technologies.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
