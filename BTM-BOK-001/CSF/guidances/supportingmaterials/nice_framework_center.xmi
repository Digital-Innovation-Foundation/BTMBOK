    About&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NICE Framework, NIST Special Publication 800-181, is a national-focused resource that categorizes and describes&#xD;
    cybersecurity work. The NICE Framework establishes a taxonomy and common lexicon that describes cybersecurity work and&#xD;
    workers irrespective of where or for whom the work is performed. The NICE Framework is intended to be applied in the&#xD;
    public, private, and academic sectors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NICE Framework is comprised of the following components:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Categories (7) – A high-level grouping of common cybersecurity functions.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Specialty Areas (33) – Distinct areas of cybersecurity work.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Work Roles (52) – The most detailed groupings cybersecurity work comprised of specific knowledge, skills, and abilities&#xD;
    required to perform tasks in a work role.&lt;br />&#xD;
    AUDIENCE&lt;br />&#xD;
    Employers, to help assess their cybersecurity workforce, identify critical gaps in cybersecurity staffing, and improve&#xD;
    position descriptions;&lt;br />&#xD;
    Current and future cybersecurity workers, to help explore Tasks and Work Roles and assist with understanding the KSAs&#xD;
    that are being valued by employers for in-demand cybersecurity jobs and positions. The NICE Framework also enables&#xD;
    staffing specialists and guidance counselors to use the NICE Framework as a resource to support these employees or job&#xD;
    seekers;&lt;br />&#xD;
    Training and certification providers seeking to help current and future members of the cybersecurity workforce gain and&#xD;
    demonstrate their KSAs;&lt;br />&#xD;
    Education providers who use the NICE Framework as a reference to develop curriculum, courses, seminars, and research&#xD;
    that cover the KSAs and Tasks described; and&lt;br />&#xD;
    Technology providers who can identify cybersecurity Work Roles and specific Tasks and KSAs associated with the services&#xD;
    and hardware/software products they supply.&#xD;
