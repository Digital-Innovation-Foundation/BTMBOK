    Achieving World-Class Operations Management&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Why is production and operations management important in both manufacturing and service firms?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What types of production processes do manufacturers and service firms use?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do organizations decide where to put their production facilities? What choices must be made in designing the&#xD;
    facility?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why are resource-planning tasks such as inventory management and supplier relations critical to production?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do operations managers schedule and control production?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How can quality-management and lean-manufacturing techniques help firms improve production and operations&#xD;
    management?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What roles do technology and automation play in manufacturing and service-industry operations management?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What key trends are affecting the way companies manage production and operations?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Nearly every type of business organization needs to find the most efficient and effective methods of producing the&#xD;
    goods or services it sells to its customers. Technological advances, ongoing competition, and consumer expectations&#xD;
    force companies to rethink where, when, and how they will produce products or services.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Manufacturers have discovered that it is no longer enough to simply push products through the factory and onto the&#xD;
    market. Consumers demand high quality at reasonable prices. They also expect manufacturers to deliver products in a&#xD;
    timely manner. Firms that can’t meet these expectations often face strong competition from businesses that can. To&#xD;
    compete, many manufacturers are streamlining how they make their products—by automating their factories, developing new&#xD;
    production processes, focusing on quality-control techniques, and improving relationships with suppliers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Service organizations also face challenges. Their customers are demanding better service, shorter waiting periods, and&#xD;
    more individualized attention. Like manufacturers, service companies are using new methods to deliver what their&#xD;
    customers need and want. Banks, for example, are using technology such as online banking and mobile apps to make their&#xD;
    services more accessible to customers. Colleges offer online courses to accommodate the schedules of working students.&#xD;
    Tax services file tax returns via the cloud.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This chapter examines how manufacturers and service firms manage and control the creation of products and services.&#xD;
    We’ll discuss production planning, including the choices firms must make concerning the type of production process they&#xD;
    will use; the location where production will occur; the design of the facility; and the management of resources needed&#xD;
    in production. Next, we’ll explain routing and scheduling, two critical tasks for controlling production and operations&#xD;
    efficiency. Then we will look at how firms can improve production and operations by employing quality management and&#xD;
    lean-manufacturing techniques. Finally, we will review some of the trends affecting production and operations&#xD;
    management.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Deborah Butler, Caterpillar&lt;br />&#xD;
    Deborah Butler is a certified Master Black Belt, but don’t expect to see her working with Jet Li anytime soon. In fact,&#xD;
    her job has little to do with martial arts. Employed by Caterpillar, “the world’s leading manufacturer of construction&#xD;
    and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines,” Butler’s Master Black Belt status&#xD;
    reflects her expertise in Six Sigma, the process Caterpillar employees use to continually manage, improve, and create&#xD;
    processes, products, and services. “Sigma” refers to the maximum number of defects tolerated in production or service&#xD;
    delivery; Six Sigma is the highest level of quality control, demanding no more than 3.4 defects per million parts. That&#xD;
    means if you were to use Six Sigma in your college career, you would miss only one half of a single question in over&#xD;
    four years of test-taking!&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Caterpillar was the first corporation to take Six Sigma global, deploying it corporate-wide in 2001 not only to its&#xD;
    almost 300 facilities, but also eventually to every dealer and more than 850 key suppliers throughout the world. The&#xD;
    corporation hails the process as a key element of its overall operations management, attributing increased profits,&#xD;
    improved customer service, and supply-chain efficiency to Six Sigma.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Caterpillar’s more than 300 Master Black Belts lead projects that use Six Sigma and train the company’s approximately&#xD;
    3,300 Black Belts in the principles of the process. Butler is currently in charge of updating and implementing Our&#xD;
    Values in Action: Caterpillar’s Worldwide Code of Conduct. Outlining the four core values of integrity, excellence,&#xD;
    teamwork, and commitment, the updated code of conduct embodies two important aspects of Caterpillar’s philosophy on Six&#xD;
    Sigma.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sigma is a Greek letter that represents a statistical unit of measurement and defines standard deviation. Caterpillar&#xD;
    uses this standard deviation for the number of errors in a product, which equates to 3.4 errors per million. Six Sigma&#xD;
    is designed to reduce the number of errors in a process by a step-by-step approach. Caterpillar uses the Six Sigma&#xD;
    methodology that utilizes the process of gathering information, analyzing the data, and then making decisions based on&#xD;
    the facts. This process ensures that Caterpillar is meeting the requirements of the customer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Caterpillar recognizes that employees are the heart of any operation. Therefore, Caterpillar employees use Six Sigma to&#xD;
    improve as people and as workers as much as to improve the products they produce. The core values, reflected in a&#xD;
    series of action statements such as “We put Integrity in action when we compete fairly,” are the product of a yearlong&#xD;
    development process involving Butler’s global team. As part of the project research, the team interviewed thousands of&#xD;
    Caterpillar employees, from officers of the company to production and hourly workers, for the purpose of, as Butler&#xD;
    says, “bringing to the surface the values that have made Caterpillar a successful enterprise, enhancing behavioral&#xD;
    expectations, and accurately expressing Caterpillar’s corporate culture.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Caterpillar is not content simply to produce Our Values in Action and leave it at that, however, and the second aspect&#xD;
    of its Six Sigma philosophy is that employees must bring the process to their lives. Butler has worked to inject the&#xD;
    code of conduct’s values into employees’ day-to-day work. If an employee writes about safety-related changes, for&#xD;
    example, she would not just list the changes. Instead, she might write first: “According to Our Values In Action, we&#xD;
    put Commitment in action when we protect the health and safety of others and ourselves. As such, we are implementing&#xD;
    the following changes. . . .” In this way, the code becomes a living part of corporate culture, a critical component of&#xD;
    operations management.&#xD;
