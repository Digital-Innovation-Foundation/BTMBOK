    The idea for this project grew out of the UPAâ€™s 2001-2002 project to investigate certification for usability&#xD;
    professionals, which included a survey of almost 1,000 people on their attitudes towards certification. At the time,&#xD;
    UPA decided not to pursue certification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    A workshop held at the UPA 2002 Conference recommended to the UPA Board several prerequisites toward certification,&#xD;
    including the definition of a Body of Knowledge. This recommendation placed a BoK in the center of several future&#xD;
    activities, including defining a curriculum, identifying roles, creating a self-assessment tool, and, maybe eventually,&#xD;
    a certification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The Usability BoK is at the center of other aspects of developing the profession, including a curriculum, role&#xD;
    development, a self-assessment tool, and eventually a certification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>2004&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    A workshop held at the UPA 2004 Conference established a vision and scope for the guide to the body of knowledge, that&#xD;
    has resulted in the activities described on this site. The workshop participants agreed that a Usability Body of&#xD;
    Knowledge should:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            Represent a broad consensus regarding the profession itself and the range of knowledge, skills, and methods&#xD;
            that should be mastered by practitioners in the field.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            Will necessarily be broad and inclusive in scope, because our profession is inherently multidisciplinary and&#xD;
            draws on a wide range of other practices.&lt;br />&#xD;
            Following that workshop, the BoK Working Group established a framework for subjects that will be included in&#xD;
            the future Usability BoK and begun recruiting volunteers for the project.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>2005&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    During the UPA 2005 Conference, the BoK Working Group led a SIG (special interest group meeting) and a poster display&#xD;
    (below), in order to discuss the BoK with UPA members and conference attendees. Input from those sessions continues to&#xD;
    inform the work of the project team.&lt;br />&#xD;
