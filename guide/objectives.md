The BTM BOK project was launched in Fall 2017 [in partnership with ITAC, MITACS and Université du Québec en Outaouais (UQO)] (https://itac.ca/blog/itac-partnership-receives-funding-mitacs-btm-body-knowledge/).

Secondary objectives of the BTM BOK relate to supporting various Human Resources Management (HRM) and Talent Management processes.

In particular, the BOK will help define seamless career paths across multiple specializations to ensure more complete experience and knowledge for digital transformation.

The core meta-model or framework of our BOK, building upon and integrating existing practices, will ensure digital leaders at all levels can rely on a logical progression of the common core competencies of their profession.

The BOK can be used for certification of digital leaders at Associate, Professional, Entrepreneur, Manager, Executive, and Fellow levels.

The BOK can also serve for accreditation of degree programs, better defining the logic of Learning Outcomes (LOs), and gauge which school is most innovative, and clarify which one is best for each digital leader as per their stage and path of professional growth.
