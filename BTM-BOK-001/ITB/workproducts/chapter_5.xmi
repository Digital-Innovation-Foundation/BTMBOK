    Entrepreneurship: Stating and Managing Your Own Business&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Why do people become entrepreneurs, and what are the different types of entrepreneurs?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What characteristics do successful entrepreneurs share?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do small businesses contribute to the U.S. economy?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the first steps to take if you are starting your own business?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Why does managing a small business present special challenges for the owner?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the advantages and disadvantages facing owners of small businesses?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How does the Small Business Administration help small businesses?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What trends are shaping entrepreneurship and small-business ownership?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Typical of many who catch the entrepreneurial bug, Natalie Tessler had a vision and pursued it single-mindedly. She is&#xD;
    just one of thousands of entrepreneurs from all age groups and backgrounds. Even kids are starting businesses and&#xD;
    high-tech firms. College graduates are shunning the corporate world to head out on their own. Downsized employees,&#xD;
    midcareer executives, and retirees who have worked for others all their lives are forming the companies they have&#xD;
    always wanted to own.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Companies started by entrepreneurs and small-business owners make significant contributions to the U.S. and global&#xD;
    economies. Hotbeds of innovation, these small businesses take leadership roles in technological change and the&#xD;
    development of new goods and services. Just how important are small businesses to our economy? Table 5.1 provides&#xD;
    insight into the role of small business in today’s economy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You may be one of the millions of Americans who’s considering joining the ranks of business owners. As you read this&#xD;
    chapter, you’ll learn why entrepreneurship continues to be one of the hottest areas of business activity. Then you’ll&#xD;
    get the information and tools you need to help you decide whether owning your own company is the right career path for&#xD;
    you. Next you’ll discover what characteristics you’ll need to become a successful entrepreneur. Then we’ll look at the&#xD;
    importance of small businesses in the economy, guidelines for starting and managing a small business, the many reasons&#xD;
    small businesses continue to thrive in the United States, and the role of the Small Business Administration. Finally,&#xD;
    the chapter explores the trends that shape entrepreneurship and small-business ownership today.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Natalie Tessler, Spa Space&lt;br />&#xD;
    Natalie Tessler has always had an entrepreneurial spirit. After she graduated from New York University’s law school,&#xD;
    she began working as a tax attorney for a large firm in Chicago. But Tessler soon realized that this left her feeling&#xD;
    unfulfilled. She didn’t want to practice law, and she didn’t want to work for someone else. “I wanted to wake up and be&#xD;
    excited for my day,” Tessler said. Not until one night, though, when she was having dinner with a friend who recently&#xD;
    had begun a writing career, did she realize it was time. “I was listening to her talk about how much she loved her job.&#xD;
    Her passion and excitement—I wanted that. I wanted something that grabbed me and propelled me through the day—and being&#xD;
    a lawyer wasn’t it.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    She began searching for what “it” was. She had a tremendous passion and talent for hospitality, entertaining others,&#xD;
    and presentation. Seeking an outlet for that flair, she found the spa industry, and the idea for Spa Space was born.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    “People think that, owning a spa, I’m able to live this glamorous lifestyle,” she laughs. “Owning a spa is nothing like&#xD;
    going to one—my nails always are broken from fixing equipment; my back is usually in pain from sitting hunched over a&#xD;
    computer trying to figure out the budget or our next marketing promotion.” Tessler is a true entrepreneur, embodying&#xD;
    the spirit and drive necessary to see her vision become a reality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tessler wanted to design a spa that focused on something new: creating a comfortable, personalized environment of&#xD;
    indulgence while not neglecting the medical technology of proper skin care. “My father’s a dermatologist, so we&#xD;
    discussed the importance of making this more than a spa where you can get a frou-frou, smell-good treatment that might&#xD;
    actually harm your skin. We both thought it was important to create an experience that is as beneficial for people’s&#xD;
    skin as it is for their emotional well-being.” To address this need, Spa Space has a medical advisory board that helps&#xD;
    with product selection, treatment design, and staff training.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Armed with a vision and a plan, Tessler turned her sights toward making it a reality. Spa Space opened in 2001 and has&#xD;
    received a great deal of national recognition for its service excellence, unique treatments and products, and its fresh&#xD;
    approach to appealing to both men and women. But it hasn’t always been smooth sailing for Spa Space. Tessler had to&#xD;
    steer the business through several obstacles, including the 9/11 tragedy just three months after the spa’s grand&#xD;
    opening, and then the Great Recession. Tessler learned to adapt her strategy by refining her target market and the&#xD;
    services Spa Space offered. Her resiliency enabled the company to not only survive difficult economic periods, but to&#xD;
    thrive and grow 17 years later into what the press recognizes as Chicago’s best spa.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tessler recently turned the reins over to Ilana Alberico, another entrepreneur and founder of Innovative Spa&#xD;
    Management, a company that has been named twice to Inc. magazine’s list of fastest growing companies. When Alberico met&#xD;
    Natalie Tessler and learned about her vision, she was inspired to invest in Spa Space. “Natalie’s vision still&#xD;
    resonates . . . I’m inspired to champion her vision into the future.”&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
