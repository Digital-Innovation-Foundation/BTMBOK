    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/concepts/uam_it_architecture_193573CD.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_XTWLgN_kEdynr9jlfK-aMA&quot;>Concept: IT Architecture&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;find the idea of &lt;em>viewpoints (views&lt;/em>&#xD;
    and &lt;em>aspects)&lt;/em> from which an system can be modeled. Location is one of the aspects, or vertical slices through&#xD;
    the system, that defines and models a perspective that is useful in understanding the system and its operation. In the&#xD;
    Unified Architecture Method (UAM), the purpose of&amp;nbsp;a Location Model&amp;nbsp;is to capture the decomposition of the&#xD;
    system into locations that host business activities. This is done at several levels of abstraction, namely Business&#xD;
    Location (the most abstract), Logical Location, and Technical Location (the least abstract, at which actual technical&#xD;
    standards for hardware and software are described).&amp;nbsp;The following is an introduction to the Technical Locations&#xD;
    Model&lt;i>.&lt;/i>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the &lt;em>Technical&lt;/em> level described here, the notion of location is used to identify and describe in detail the&#xD;
    classes of location at which the system has a presence. Computational aspects are made specific at this level, such as&#xD;
    &lt;em>server make and model&lt;/em>, &lt;em>storage&lt;/em> &lt;em>make and model&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>network component&lt;/em> &lt;em>makes and&#xD;
    models&lt;/em>. The Technical Locations Model supports this viewpoint by describing what business activities are carried&#xD;
    on at the defined locations, and organizes them into a simple model. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_technical_pers_C469D0B5.html&quot; guid=&quot;_5qRZYAbnEeSyDIZvZjuaLg&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Technical Perspective&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>&lt;u>Note&lt;/u>:&lt;/strong> Since UAM&amp;nbsp;may&amp;nbsp;be used to model&amp;nbsp;the complete enterprise (or business&#xD;
        domain), the level of detail to be included in this model is a judgment call of the architect, based upon:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN-LEFT: 2em&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The objective of the architecture effort&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The size of the enterprise or (business line)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Time and resource constraints&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The locations model works best if layering is used to deal with complexity, and to provide views appropriate for the&#xD;
    audience and objectives; and comprehension is greatly improved. Detail is hidden, while allowing for it to be defined&#xD;
    in lower layers, as required to meet the objectives of the architecture effort. For example, at each 'location' layers&#xD;
    at different levels of complexity may be used to show the boundary network technologies, with more detail for enclosed&#xD;
    components being provided at lower layers. These layers may also be partitioned in order to separate out the different&#xD;
    aspects (i.e. entity, process, network and role). The main focus of the technical locations model is the 'network'&#xD;
    aspect. The network topology and technologies are defined,&amp;nbsp;as generic patterns at each location, or they may be&#xD;
    specific in terms of technologies and where and how to use them, such as 'CISCO Router/Firewall XYZ' with configuration&#xD;
    'abc'. These standards and patterns may be shown in this model (providing an overall picture), however they&#xD;
    &lt;em>must&lt;/em> be documented in Architectural Decisions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Technical Locations Model is used, within the enterprise architecture context, to either specify technical patterns&#xD;
    for the enterprise, or (if the scope, scale and resources are appropriate for the architecture being developed) to&#xD;
    document a view of the system's locations very close to the implementation level. Both may be described, if desired and&#xD;
    appropriate, as well.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The locations model is key to the technical view. It is used to show how entities (data), processes and the network&#xD;
    aspects (and the required supporting infrastructure) are organized and deployed throughout the system. In other words,&#xD;
    some entity model, process model and roles model aspects may be shown in the locations model. Partitioning and layering&#xD;
    is used to separate these aspects in the locations model. Non-functional aspects should also be clearly documented at&#xD;
    this technical level (e.g., data rates, transaction profiles, latency requirements, etc.)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Location Design&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following procedure helps determine a realistic approach (mainly for a &quot;green field&quot;; existing systems or&#xD;
    enterprises may have clear definitions for locations and deployment of services that in essence constrain the IT&#xD;
    architecture):&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Look at each activity to see how the involved actors should be physically located in order to optimally perform the&#xD;
        tasks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Consider&amp;nbsp;the needs of equipment and premises for each actor.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Look at the whole system and related activities, and consider: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Which actors participate in several activities?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Which activities make use of each other's results?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        With this as a basis, identify the optimal location of each activity and actor.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Compare this with the current situation and ask yourself: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What is a realistic change within the mandate of the project?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What is the most cost-effective location?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What is mandatory? What can the organization live without?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What can be compensated for by having the right equipment?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What can be compensated for by having the right location?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Consider the effect of relocating an entire system on the activities/processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Estimate the cost per business process to change the location according to what you have discovered. Determine&#xD;
        whether the investment is realistic.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, a mobile data solution must be considered for a sales person who needs direct access to company databases&#xD;
    while at the customer's offices. Having video-conferencing equipment installed sometimes compensates for the&#xD;
    disadvantage of having the members of a development team located at different sites.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Locations and Connections&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>location&lt;/b> represents the &lt;i>physical&lt;/i> partitioning and distribution of the system, and is concerned&#xD;
    with the geographic placement of&amp;nbsp;system resources (buildings, points-of-presence, and other notions) along with&#xD;
    the business activities provided there. A locality expresses notionally where business process are supported, thus&#xD;
    there is a strong connection between &lt;em>location&lt;/em> and &lt;em>activity&lt;/em>.&amp;nbsp;The semantics of locality at the&#xD;
    technical level implies a tight grouping of&amp;nbsp;activities at locations and&amp;nbsp;how the activity is to be supported.&#xD;
    It is conceivable for very complex, very large systems (i.e. enterprise architectures), that there might&amp;nbsp;be&#xD;
    locations that decompose to finer-grained localities (just as a system might contain subsystems), and locations that&#xD;
    are all identical except for their physical location (for example bank ATMs). The description of a location includes an&#xD;
    indication of the&amp;nbsp;location being defined (e.g. Headquarters, factory, point-of-presence, etc.) along with the&#xD;
    activities supported&amp;nbsp;at the location.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Technical Locations Model is also used to define the physical connections between the locations. Based on the&#xD;
    activities to be supported at the locations, the process and interactions between locales is characterized, which&#xD;
    helps&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;design of &amp;nbsp;connections between the localities (and possibly with the design of the&#xD;
    applications that need to work across these connections).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;model diagrams show how business processes are distributed across the system's locations, and how they are&#xD;
    connected. In the low level&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>Technical&lt;/em> view, to be developed based upon the logical-level view, the&#xD;
    location of computing resources is defined along with their technical details, all of which is important when&#xD;
    considering functional and non-functional requirements. For many systems engineers, this is &quot;the architecture&quot;, the&#xD;
    Logical and Technical level&amp;nbsp;location views.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The locations model consist of two elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Location&lt;/strong> - a location is a collection&amp;nbsp;of enterprise activities&amp;nbsp;(processes and&#xD;
        tasks)&amp;nbsp;that provide enterprise services at that location.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Connections&lt;/strong> - pathways (for information, mass, energy, or discrete physical items) supporting the&#xD;
        required process interactions between locations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The semantics of the location diagrams are similar to those of UML deployment diagrams, and locations are represented&#xD;
    as stereotyped UML nodes. In the UML standard, a node is a classifier that &quot;... is a physical object that represents a&#xD;
    processing resource, generally, having at least a memory and often processing capability as well. Nodes include&#xD;
    computing devices but also human resources or mechanical processing resources.&quot; Therefore, UML allows us to extend the&#xD;
    semantics of nodes, and the associations that connect them, through stereotyping and the application of tagged values.&#xD;
    This is used to define locations and connections. The icon for a&amp;nbsp;top-level technical location&amp;nbsp;is a building&#xD;
    (see the illustrations in&amp;nbsp;the illustration below).&amp;nbsp; Other modeling elements are also defined that support the&#xD;
    definition of servers, routers, telecommunications links and other useful&amp;nbsp;notions at the physical level including&#xD;
    &lt;em>domain&lt;/em> and &lt;em>zone&lt;/em> that are used to address IT security requirements, see: &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/whitepapers/uam_security_reference_model_3EA07B63.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_KGs_oMX8EdyDYN2-y9-AqA&quot;>Whitepaper: A Reference Model for Enterprise Security&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each location in the&amp;nbsp;locations&amp;nbsp;model has a description of additional non-functional aspects&amp;nbsp;which&#xD;
    specify quality (reliability, maintainability, safety, and so on), physical and environmental requirements, and&#xD;
    development constraints (cost, technical risk, and so forth). From these requirements, the actual characteristics (of&#xD;
    each location) are determined; obviously these are chosen to meet the explicit requirements at least, but can exceed&#xD;
    the requirements if sound engineering practice dictates this—for example, to cope with unexpected capacity demands.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Locations are characterized with:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Activities&lt;/strong> - a list of the activities provided at the location, which relates directly to the&#xD;
        Business Process Model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Logical level non-functional requirements&lt;/strong> - things such as importance, reliability, survivability,&#xD;
        performance, capacity, and availability requirements of the location. These attributes may be different for each&#xD;
        business activity (and the supporting components) at a location.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Connections are characterized by the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Activities&lt;/strong> - the business activities that traverse the link and the supported protocols.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Logical level non-functional requirements&lt;/strong> - things such as volumes, importance, capacity, data&#xD;
        rate, survivability and availability requirements of the communications path.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Location Diagrams&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The figure shows a simple Technical Location Model for an enterprise. The enterprise has a number of retail stores,&#xD;
    central warehouses, and a web presence. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_diagrams_in_technical_pers_877C1261.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_sQx18OrgEdytvcf-4U2D3Q&quot;>Guideline: Technical Perspective Views&lt;/a>. The figures below illustrate how detailed or&#xD;
    generic the model can be, depending (as always) on the objectives, size, scope and resources available to produce the&#xD;
    model. For larger organizations,&amp;nbsp;the more generic approach is used, which define the technical patterns, the&#xD;
    technical standards for the various &quot;locales&quot;, and additionally some rules on usage of the standards and patterns. A&#xD;
    generic view of the&amp;nbsp;ThuNorTech Headquarters Domain&amp;nbsp;is shown, with&amp;nbsp; just a few elements&amp;nbsp;(i.e.,&#xD;
    Zones,Domain PEP and external Domains) being defined.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;High-level Technical Locations Model for the headquarters location&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./resources/EA-Technical-TLM-HQ.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Layering is used to advantage in technical level models (see &quot;Layer the Models&quot; in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/concepts/uam_complex_modelling_A4EC9E37.html#Layered%20Business%20Models&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_PjkWoObaEdyjVoHXO3Mbfg&quot;>Concept: Complex IT Architectures&lt;/a>). For example, a more detailed layer for &quot;Core&#xD;
    Zone&quot; is defined, the next layer of detail for&amp;nbsp;it would appear in a sub-diagram that is shown below. The &quot;drill&#xD;
    down&quot; decorator (&lt;img alt=&quot;Drill Down Decorator&quot; src=&quot;./resources/Drill-Down.png&quot; />) on&amp;nbsp;the Core Zone indicates&#xD;
    that there is more&amp;nbsp;detail in another diagram, shown below.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Technical Locations Model of the Core Zone&quot; src=&quot;./resources/EA-Technical-TLM-Core%20Zone.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This view illustrates that there is a &lt;em>Backbone&lt;/em> network that interconnects the various &quot;zones&quot; or sub-networks&#xD;
    together. This &lt;em>Backbone&lt;/em> network is in turn connected, through a Domain PEP to the Internet. Zones are&#xD;
    typically defined based upon the functional divisions within the system or enterprise, as shown in the figure. However,&#xD;
    non-functional considerations may influence how the zones (sub-networks) are defined as well. The &quot;drill down&quot;&#xD;
    decorator (&lt;img alt=&quot;Drill Down Decorator&quot; src=&quot;./resources/Drill-Down.png&quot; />) on&amp;nbsp;the &lt;em>Backbone&lt;/em> indicates&#xD;
    that there is more&amp;nbsp;detail in another diagram, which is shown below.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;Technical Locations Model of the Backbone network&quot; src=&quot;./resources/EA-Technical-TLM-Backbone.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At this technical level these routers and switches may all be specified to a very detailed level (i.e., makes and&#xD;
    models). Since this is part of an Enterprise Architecture, these specifications, including the network topology, define&#xD;
    the enterprise technical standards and usage patterns.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
