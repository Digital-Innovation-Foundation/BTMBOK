  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The concept for the NICE Framework began before the establishment of NICE in 2010 and grew out of the recognition that&#xD;
    the cybersecurity workforce had not been defined and assessed. To address this challenge, the Federal Chief Information&#xD;
    Officers (CIO) Council took on the task in 2008 to provide a standard framework to understand the cybersecurity roles&#xD;
    within the federal government. The first version was posted in September 2012. A subsequent U.S. government-wide review&#xD;
    noted specific areas to be further examined and refined. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) gathered input and&#xD;
    validated final recommendations via focus groups with subject matter experts from around the country and across&#xD;
    industry, academia, and government resulting in a second version of the NICE Framework, version 2.0, shared publicly in&#xD;
    2014. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) expanded on version 2.0 through internal engagements with service&#xD;
    components and external engagements with the private sector. The DHS and NIST co-authors worked with OSD to refine&#xD;
    their expansion to become the current version, published in August 2017, with a goal to emphasize private sector&#xD;
    applicability and to reinforce the vision that the NICE Framework is a reference resource for both the public and&#xD;
    private sectors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE NICE FRAMEWORK&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (aka the NICE Framework), NIST Special Publication 800-181, is a national&#xD;
    focused resource that categorizes and describes cybersecurity work.&#xD;
