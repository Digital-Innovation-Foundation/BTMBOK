  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The &lt;strong>Business Perspective&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;has the following parts or aspects:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li style=&quot;LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;a id=&quot;XE_Business_Perspective&quot; name=&quot;XE_Business_Perspective&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Entity Model -&lt;/strong> model of business entities consumed and produced by Business Activities;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Process Model -&lt;/strong> model of the structure of Business Activities (which produce&#xD;
        and&amp;nbsp;consume entities), forming processes;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Locations Model -&lt;/strong> model of the Business Locations where the &quot;system&quot; has a presence;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Roles Model -&lt;/strong> model of the Business Actors/Roles (Note: Only Actors defined at the&#xD;
        Business level).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each of these viewpoints is actually a collection of models that (typically hierarchically) define the aspect. See: &lt;a&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_W4UEAMqpEdy25fQyv59CjQ&quot;>Concept: Architecture Perspectives and Viewpoints&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of the Business Perspective&amp;nbsp;is to describe &lt;i>how&lt;/i> the business operates (activities and&#xD;
    processes), &lt;i>what&lt;/i> is involved in these processes (entities), &lt;em>where&lt;/em>&amp;nbsp;the business has a presence&#xD;
    (locations), and &lt;em>who&lt;/em> interacts with the&amp;nbsp;business activities (actors/roles). It makes no assumptions about&#xD;
    the structure of the business or how business activities are implemented. The Business Perspective, on the other hand,&#xD;
    concretely defines the services offered by the business (to be invoked by business actors/roles in the performance of&#xD;
    business activities), defines the internal business actors and the information they use (the business entities), and to&#xD;
    some extent describes the structural organization (business organizations), and defines how they all interact through&#xD;
    the definition of business processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Perspective describes business structures and interactions without&amp;nbsp;necessarily prescribing design&#xD;
    choices for business actor/role and business entities in terms of role bindings (to human workers (users) or automated&#xD;
    systems). That is the purpose of the&amp;nbsp;Logical Perspective, into which the Business Perspective evolves, as&#xD;
    automation and refactoring options are explored.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Perspective is used by stakeholders and business-process analysts to understand how the business currently&#xD;
    works (if in an &lt;em>as-is&lt;/em> form), and to analyze the effect of changes to the business (if in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>to-be&lt;/em>&#xD;
    form). The IT architect is responsible for the structure and integrity of the model, while business designers are&#xD;
    responsible for detailing elements within the model. The model is&amp;nbsp;used by architects for deriving the Logical&#xD;
    Perspective models.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>The Business Perspective describes how the business works internally to perform business activities and provide services.&#xD;
Therefore, the model is essential when considering changes to the business processes or when augmenting or reducing the&#xD;
scope (mandate) of the &quot;system&quot;—reasoning about such changes without this model is impossible. Also, failure to produce a&#xD;
Business Perspective&amp;nbsp;means you run the risk that architects and designers will give only superficial attention to the&#xD;
way business is done. They will do what they know best, which is to design and create software in the absence of business&#xD;
(process) knowledge.&amp;nbsp;The result can be that the systems that are built do not properly support the needs of the&#xD;
business and opportunities for optimizations will be missed.&amp;nbsp;</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the objective of the business modeling effort is simply to specify &lt;em>new&lt;/em> capabilities, or to formulate a&#xD;
    business vision, then the Business Perspective is not needed, or may be very simple and high-level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When the intention is to improve some aspect of business performance, and perhaps change the business processes, for&#xD;
    example, through the introduction&amp;nbsp;of automation, then it is likely that the Business Perspective will evolve into&#xD;
    a&amp;nbsp;Logical Perspective, with choices made&amp;nbsp;about role bindings&amp;nbsp;(human, software, system).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Whether you choose to&amp;nbsp;keep and maintain the two perspectives—the Business Perspective and&amp;nbsp;the Logical&#xD;
    Perspective—depends on a number of&amp;nbsp;considerations: the&amp;nbsp;Business Perspective must be&amp;nbsp;retained,&amp;nbsp;to be&#xD;
    useful it must&amp;nbsp;be maintained alongside the Logical Model, which is costly. If the business is stable, then the&#xD;
    Business Perspective is useful because it will not change but it does allow technology decisions, which&amp;nbsp;do not&#xD;
    affect the more abstract business structure, to be revisited more easily. Therefore, if the business is well understood&#xD;
    by all stakeholders, the enterprise and domain architects,&amp;nbsp;and the project team, the benefits of developing a&#xD;
    Business Perspective are significantly diminished. Where this occurs, the Business Perspective may be omitted&#xD;
    entirely—but &lt;em>not&lt;/em> recommended! It is usually a good idea to develop at least a minimal Business Perspective&#xD;
    (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>to-be&lt;/em>)&amp;nbsp;to improve understanding among stakeholders of the way the business works: to develop&#xD;
    the common language and concepts of the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Model describes the &quot;system&quot; in terms of Business Entities, Business Processes, Business Locations, and&#xD;
    Business Actors/Roles. It serves as an abstraction of how these aspects need to be related and how they collaborate in&#xD;
    the business. It also defines the business services that are invoked by Business Actors/Roles.&#xD;

    &lt;strong>Extends:&lt;/strong> «metaclass» Package&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Perspective&amp;nbsp;has the following parts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Introduction -&lt;/strong> A textual description that serves as a brief introduction to the models;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Aspects:&lt;/strong> The architectural aspects of the perspective, with each possibly defining a hierarchy of&#xD;
        detail under four top level models: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>Business Entity Model -&lt;/strong> model of business entities consumed and produced by logical&#xD;
                functions&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>Business Process Model -&lt;/strong> model of the structure of business activities (which produce&#xD;
                and&amp;nbsp;consume logical entities), forming processes&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>Business Locations Model -&lt;/strong> model of the business locations&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>Business Roles Model -&lt;/strong> model of the business actors/roles&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Perspective is a way of expressing the business processes in terms of responsibilities, deliverables, and&#xD;
    collaborative behavior. When a new business line or activity is to be added to the enterprise (e.g. A retailer adding&#xD;
    &quot;online purchasing&quot;), creating a Business Model is mandatory in order to assess the impact of the new activity on the&#xD;
    way the business works. Note that the management organization of the enterprise is orthogonal to the business model --&#xD;
    in other words organizational changes do not affect the mandate, activities and processes within the enterprise (but&#xD;
    often the two (i.e. business change and organizational change) are done at once).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are&amp;nbsp;two main variants of the Business Perspective:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>As-Is&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Define&amp;nbsp;the current (&lt;em>as-is&lt;/em>) models;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>To-Be&lt;/strong> - Define&amp;nbsp;the target (&lt;em>to-be&lt;/em>) models.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;As-Is and To-Be Models&quot; name=&quot;As-Is and To-Be Models&quot;>&lt;em>As-Is&lt;/em> and &lt;em>To-Be&lt;/em> Models&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is to do business process reengineering, you should consider building&#xD;
    two perspectives: one that shows the current situation (the &lt;em>as-is&lt;/em> Logical Perspective) and one that shows the&#xD;
    envisioned new situation (target or &lt;em>to-be&lt;/em> Business Perspective).&amp;nbsp; The &lt;em>as-is&lt;/em> model are defined at&#xD;
    the Logical level since they will be typically based upon system documentation, and not existing IT architectures. In&#xD;
    this case a Business Perspective is not needed, but this is an optional starting point for the definition of the&#xD;
    &lt;em>to-be&lt;/em> models.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The &lt;em>as-is&lt;/em> version of the Business Perspective is simply an inventory of the Business Activities. The elements&#xD;
    of the Business Model are not described in any detail. Typically, brief descriptions are sufficient. The Business&#xD;
    Activities can be documented with simple diagrams, where swimlanes correspond to organizational elements&amp;nbsp;within&#xD;
    the system.&amp;nbsp; The target &lt;em>to-be&lt;/em> version of the Business Model requires most of the work. The current&#xD;
    processes and structures need to be reconsidered and re-aligned with the business strategy and goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;To-Be Model&quot; name=&quot;To-Be Model&quot;>&lt;em>To-Be&lt;/em> Model&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you are business modeling to define a new line of business or new product/service offering, for example, there is&#xD;
    no existing business framework from which to create an &lt;em>as-is&lt;/em> model. You should look for reference business&#xD;
    architectures and processes to assist you in the creation of the target model.&#xD;
