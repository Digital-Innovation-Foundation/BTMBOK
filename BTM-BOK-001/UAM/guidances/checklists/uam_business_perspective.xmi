    The checklist below is provided to help in determining if the Business Perspective is complete, well-defined and&#xD;
    comprehensible. An overall review is suggested,&amp;nbsp;and reviews and checks for the various aspects (viewpoints) are&#xD;
    provided. Again it must be stressed that clear language and consistency in its usage is important in documenting and&#xD;
    communicating the architecture. This is particularly important at the business level.&#xD;

    <sectionName> In general, the business architecture appears to be reasonable if</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica-Bold&quot;>Overall, the architecture is sound, because:&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The architecture appears to be stable. &#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            The need for stability is dictated by follow-on phases. Instability at this level results in even higher&#xD;
            instability in the lower level Logical and Technical perspectives.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            The importance of a stable architecture cannot be overstated. Do not be deceived into thinking that 'pretty&#xD;
            close is good enough'—unstable is unstable, and it is better to get the architecture right and delay the move&#xD;
            to the Logical or Technical view rather than proceed.&amp;nbsp;Changes to higher level&amp;nbsp;architecture&#xD;
            perspectives and viewpoint models have broad impact: they tend to be expensive, disruptive and demoralizing.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            The real difficulty of assessing architectural stability is that &quot;you don't know what you don't know&quot;;&#xD;
            stability is measured relative to expected change. As a result, stability is essentially a subjective measure.&#xD;
            We can, however, base this subjectivity on more than just conjecture. The architecture itself is developed by&#xD;
            considering 'architecturally significant' scenarios—sub-sets of activities that represent the most&#xD;
            technologically challenging behavior the system must support. Assessing the stability of the architecture&#xD;
            involves ensuring that the architecture has broad coverage, to ensure that there will be no 'surprises' in the&#xD;
            architecture going forward.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            Past experience with the architecture can also be a good indicator: if the rate of change in the architecture&#xD;
            is low, and remains low as new scenarios are covered, there is good reason to believe that the architecture is&#xD;
            stabilizing. Conversely, if each new scenario causes changes in the architecture, it is still evolving and&#xD;
            baselining is not yet warranted.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The architecture is consistent, coherent and comprehensible&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The architect can understand enough from the architecture to successfully develop the&amp;nbsp;Logical Perspective.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The packaging approach reduces complexity and improves understanding.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        Packages have been defined to be highly cohesive within the package, while the packages themselves are loosely&#xD;
        coupled.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The&amp;nbsp;architecture can be easily understood by someone generally knowledgeable in the business area.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        Existing Architectural Decisions&amp;nbsp;have been consulted and followed.&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
        The architecture does not appear to be &quot;over-designed&quot;. &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
                The structures and detail is sufficient for comprehension.&#xD;
