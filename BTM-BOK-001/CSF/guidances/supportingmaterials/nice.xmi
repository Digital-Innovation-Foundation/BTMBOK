  <mainDescription>The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology&#xD;
(NIST) in the U.S. Department of Commerce, is a partnership between government, academia, and the private sector focused on&#xD;
cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development. Located in the Information Technology Laboratory&amp;nbsp; at&#xD;
NIST, the NICE Program Office operates under the Applied Cybersecurity Division, positioning the program to support the&#xD;
countryâ€™s ability to address current and future cybersecurity challenges through standards and best practices.&lt;br />&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
The mission of NICE is to energize and promote a robust network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity education, training, and&#xD;
workforce development. NICE fulfills this mission by coordinating with government, academic, and industry partners to build&#xD;
on existing successful programs, facilitate change and innovation, and bring leadership and vision to increase the number&#xD;
of skilled cybersecurity professionals helping to keep our Nation secure.&lt;br />&#xD;
NICE Strategic Plan&lt;br />&#xD;
The NICE Strategic Plan is the result of engagement and deliberation among NICE partners in government, academia, and&#xD;
industry. The overall intent of the Strategic Plan is to provoke a national conversation and guide action on how to address&#xD;
the critical shortage of a skilled cybersecurity workforce. &lt;br />&#xD;
NICE Working Group&lt;br />&#xD;
The NICE Working Group (NICEWG) has been established to provide a mechanism in which public and private sector participants&#xD;
can develop concepts, design strategies, and pursue actions that advance cybersecurity education, training, and workforce&#xD;
development.&lt;br />&#xD;
NICE Interagency Coordinating Council&lt;br />&#xD;
The NICE Interagency Coordinating Council (ICC) convenes federal government partners of NICE for consultation,&#xD;
communication, and coordination of policy initiatives and strategic directions related to cybersecurity education,&#xD;
training, and workforce development. &lt;br /></mainDescription>
