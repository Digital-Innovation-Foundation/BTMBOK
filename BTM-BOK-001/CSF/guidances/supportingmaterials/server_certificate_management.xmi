    Current Status&lt;br />&#xD;
    The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) has released the final version of National Institute of&#xD;
    Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Practice Guide Special Publication 1800-16, Securing Web Transactions:&#xD;
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) Server Certificate Management. See the two-page fact sheet for an overview of the&#xD;
    project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This practice guide can benefit executives, chief Information security officers, system administrators, or anyone who&#xD;
    has a stake in protecting his or her organization's data, privacy, and overall operational security.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For ease of use, the final guide is available to download or read in volumes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Summary&lt;br />&#xD;
    The NCCoE at NIST recognizes the vital importance of securing web transactions and other communications between clients&#xD;
    and servers for organizations. This project uses commercially available technologies to demonstrate how medium and&#xD;
    large enterprises that rely on Transport Layer Security (TLS) can secure both customer-facing and internal applications&#xD;
    can better manage TLS server certificates by:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Defining operational and security policies; identifying roles and responsibilities&lt;br />&#xD;
    Establishing comprehensive certificate inventories and ownership tracking&lt;br />&#xD;
    Conducting continuous monitoring of certificate operational and security status&lt;br />&#xD;
    Automating certificate management to minimize human error and maximize efficiency on a large scale&lt;br />&#xD;
    Enabling rapid migration to new certificates and keys when cryptographic mechanisms are found to be weak, compromised&#xD;
    or vulnerable&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;In December 2018, the NCCoE released Volumes A and B of this guide to provide enterprises actionable guidance to&#xD;
    help them establish and implement a formal TLS server certificate management program. The received comments were&#xD;
    adjudicated and integrated into the updated draft versions of Volume A and B. With the release of the full guide,&#xD;
    organizations can advance their TLS management efforts by reading Volume C which explains our approach, architecture,&#xD;
    and security characteristics, and Volume D which contains the how-to-guides to build the example solutions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although client certificates may optionally be used in TLS to perform mutual authentication, managing client&#xD;
    certificates is outside this project's scope.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Collaborating Vendors&lt;br />&#xD;
    Organizations participating in this project submitted their capabilities in response to an open call in the Federal&#xD;
    Register for all sources of relevant security capabilities from academia and industry (vendors and integrators). The&#xD;
    following respondents with relevant capabilities or product components (identified as “Technology&#xD;
    Partners/Collaborators” herein) signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to collaborate with NIST in a&#xD;
    consortium to build this example solution.&#xD;
