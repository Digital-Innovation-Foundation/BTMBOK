    &lt;i style=&quot;BOX-SIZING: border-box; WIDTH: auto&quot;>Introduction to Business&lt;/i>&lt;span>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>covers the scope and&#xD;
    sequence of most introductory business courses. The book provides detailed explanations in the context of core themes&#xD;
    such as customer satisfaction, ethics, entrepreneurship, global business, and managing change. Introduction to Business&#xD;
    includes hundreds of current business examples from a range of industries and geographic locations, which feature a&#xD;
    variety of individuals. The outcome is a balanced approach to the theory and application of business concepts, with&#xD;
    attention to the knowledge and skills necessary for student success in this course and beyond.&#xD;

    About OpenStax&lt;br />&#xD;
    OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and itâ€™s our mission to improve student access to education. Our&#xD;
    first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012, and our library has since scaled to over 25 books for&#xD;
    college and AP&amp;reg; courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. OpenStax Tutor, our low-cost personalized learning&#xD;
    tool, is being used in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships with philanthropic foundations&#xD;
    and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to&#xD;
    learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.&#xD;
