    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Acer Group—Becoming a Hardware + Software + Services Global Competitor&lt;br />&#xD;
    Do you think that you would be interested in a career in the technology space? Here is an overview of the history of&#xD;
    Acer Corporation that will provide a glimpse into this industry. Acer Group was established in 1976. The Acer Group’s&#xD;
    family of brands includes Acer, Gateway, Packard Bell, and eMachines. The multibrand strategy of Acer allows each brand&#xD;
    to target different customer needs in the worldwide personal computer market. Acer was the third-largest maker of&#xD;
    personal computers (second largest in notebooks) in 2008 and had revenues exceeding $16 billion. In 2017, Acer is sixth&#xD;
    in the personal computer industry with revenues exceeding $70 billion. This Taiwanese firm has established itself as a&#xD;
    global player in the PC market and has expanded into gaming and other related businesses. How it got there is through&#xD;
    innovative use of alliances and acquisitions as well as forward-looking development within the firm.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Firm’s History&lt;br />&#xD;
    Acer was founded in 1976 as Multitech. The focus of Multitech was on trade and product design (internal innovation).&#xD;
    Just three years later, Multitech designed Taiwan’s first mass-produced computer product. The focus from the start was&#xD;
    on a product for export—Taiwan is such a small market the firm knew it needed to make a global footprint in the&#xD;
    computer market. Multitech, which became Acer in 1987, developed a long-term mission to allow anyone to use and benefit&#xD;
    from technology. They have built their reputation on development and manufacturing of sophisticated, intuitive,&#xD;
    easy-to-use products.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Early Innovations&lt;br />&#xD;
    When Multitech first started, the PC market was young and the founders saw many opportunities. Acer holds more patents&#xD;
    than any other Taiwanese-based corporation, and Taiwan accounts for 70 percent of global computer hardware&#xD;
    manufacturing. When Acer beat IBM to the market with 32-bit PCs in 1986, it signaled the beginning of the end for IBM’s&#xD;
    PC business. Until 1990, Acer was more internally innovative than it was externally oriented for alliances and&#xD;
    acquisitions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    External Technology Development&lt;br />&#xD;
    In 1990, Altos Peripherals was acquired. This marked the beginning of two decades of multiple alliances and&#xD;
    acquisitions by Acer. Because of Acer’s success in developing innovations, other companies were willing and eager to&#xD;
    development different types of alliances. Some of the early alliances allowed Acer to partner with some of the biggest&#xD;
    players in the computer technology industry. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    1996—Acer signed a reciprocal patent licensing agreement with IBM, Intel, and Texas Instruments allowing use of one&#xD;
    other’s patented technology.&lt;br />&#xD;
    1999—Acer Group and IBM formed a seven-year procurement and technology alliance.&lt;br />&#xD;
    This strategy has continued:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    2010—Acer and Founder Technology signed a memorandum of mutual understanding to strengthen their long-term PC business&#xD;
    cooperation.&lt;br />&#xD;
    2016—Acer’s board of directors approved the establishment of a joint venture with Starbreeze AB to design, manufacture,&#xD;
    promote, market, and serve StarVR Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays.&lt;br />&#xD;
    As Acer grew in strength in the marketplace, it began to make acquisitions. These acquisitions were aimed at&#xD;
    multibranding as well as obtaining technological innovations. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    1998—Acer acquired Texas Instruments’ TI-Acer interest and renamed the company Acer Semiconductor Manufacturing&#xD;
    Inc.&lt;br />&#xD;
    2007—Acer merged with Gateway Inc.&lt;br />&#xD;
    2008—Acer merged with Packard Bell Inc.&lt;br />&#xD;
    2008—Acer acquired E-TEN.&lt;br />&#xD;
    2015—Acer acquired GPS cycling computer brand Xplova.&lt;br />&#xD;
    2016—Acer acquired wireless pet camera maker Pawbo.&lt;br />&#xD;
    To illustrate the usefulness of this strategy, in 2011 Acer Inc. bought iGware Inc. for $320 million to try to enter&#xD;
    the potentially lucrative cloud market. Then in 2012, Acer created cloud software and infrastructure tools for devices.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Acer also developed equity-based partnerships. Examples of this strategy include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    2009—Acer acquired 29.9% of Olidata.&lt;br />&#xD;
    2015—Acer invested in robotics start-up company Jibo.&lt;br />&#xD;
    2016—Acer made an equity investment in grandPad, a provider of technology solutions specifically designed for senior&#xD;
    citizens.&lt;br />&#xD;
    2017—Acer became largest corporate shareholder of AOPEN Inc.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Becoming a Global Competitor&lt;br />&#xD;
    While Acer was changing its business model from internal innovations as well as evolving from a manufacturing company&#xD;
    to a development and marketing firm, it continued to spread its global footprint. It did this through various&#xD;
    partnerships and by developing innovative products with its partners and within its own R&amp;amp;D areas. For example, in&#xD;
    2003 Acer launched the Empowering Technology Platform to meld hardware, software, and service to provide end-to-end&#xD;
    technologies to customers. In 2008, the Aspire One was launched as the company’s first mobile Internet device. In&#xD;
    addition, Acer made a strong move into the high-end gaming market with the Aspire Predator series.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These steps were designed to enhance and strengthen Acer’s global position. Acer’s product range includes PC notebooks&#xD;
    and netbooks, desktop computers, storage systems, peripheral devices, LCD televisions, and e-business solutions. The&#xD;
    firm is number one in a number of markets with various products. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) market is a&#xD;
    stronghold for Acer’s mobile computing solutions. Acer is the largest supplier of LCD televisions in Western Europe.&#xD;
    Acer is first in the notebook market in Italy, Spain, Austria, Holland, Switzerland, Russia, Belgium, Denmark, Hungary,&#xD;
    Poland, and the Slovakian Republic.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the United States and Canada, Acer is making its mark through its Channel Business Model (CBM). It developed this&#xD;
    model as it expanded beyond Taiwan and continued to improve it as it divested its manufacturing facilities. This model&#xD;
    allows Acer to be flexible in adapting to global IT market trends. CBM involves collaboration with partners and&#xD;
    suppliers to develop and market top-tier products and services. In 2003, they used this model to co-brand a notebook&#xD;
    computer with Ferrari, the Italian carmaker.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In 2009, Acer unveiled the Acer F900 and M900 smartphones at the Mobile World Congress. They began by shipping to&#xD;
    channel partners in EMEA and Asia. These products have a relatively large 3.8-inch-wide VGA display and a 3.75G HSPA&#xD;
    connectivity for high-speed data transfer, and they are the introductory products with Acer’s new widget-based user&#xD;
    interface that provides easy navigation with vivid 3D animation. The acquisition of Packard Bell was key to Acer’s&#xD;
    entrance into this market with this advanced product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    From 2008 to 2013, Acer’s strategy was to enhance worldwide presence with a new multibrand strategy. With the&#xD;
    successful completion of the mergers of Gateway and Packard Bell, Acer then heavily emphasized its goal to further&#xD;
    strengthen its global footprint with a multibrand strategy and solid partnerships. Since 2014, the Acer Group has been&#xD;
    transforming into a hardware + software + services company.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To accomplish this shift, Acer needed to spin off or divest certain units. This accomplished two things: 1) it made&#xD;
    cash available for acquisitions and other new business development, and 2) it refocused the strategy of Acer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples of the spin-offs and divestments included:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    2000—Acer spun off its manufacturing operation to focus on developing technologically advanced, user-friendly&#xD;
    solutions.&lt;br />&#xD;
    2000—Acer split off its OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) business unit to create Wistron Corp., an independent&#xD;
    design and IT manufacturing company.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Acer continues to lead in notebook technology while extending its product lines to enhance people’s lives through&#xD;
    technology. In notebook technology, Acer was the leader in branding notebooks (Ferrari 4000 carbon-fiber&#xD;
    notebook—2005), green notebooks (2010), and lightest notebook with the longest battery life (Aspire line—2012), as well&#xD;
    as the Chromebook launch in 2015 with a 15.6-inch screen. However, its product lines have multiplied into cloud&#xD;
    technology, gaming, and other technologies that “add value to customers’ lives” (Acer annual report).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Acer has used a variety of strategic moves to continue to be competitive in the changing world of computer-related&#xD;
    technology. Early on, they used internal innovation as a primary growth strategy to build reputation and establish a&#xD;
    footprint in the industry. Then they used external methods of acquiring technology and markets—mergers, acquisitions,&#xD;
    alliances, joint ventures, equity positions, etc. Acer continues to nurture its strengths in research and development&#xD;
    while continuing to look for new opportunities for acquisition and alliances.&#xD;
