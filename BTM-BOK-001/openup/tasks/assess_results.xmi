&#xD;
with the team how the iteration results with be best presented to stakeholders so they can learn as much about the solution&#xD;
&#xD;
as possible. The project manager also listens what the team has to say about what went wrong and what went right during the&#xD;
&#xD;
iteration. This knowledge will help everybody to make informed decisions for next iteration planning and determine the best&#xD;
&#xD;
course of action for the project. This task is performed at the end of every iteration until the end of the project.</mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Towards the end of the iteration, the team jointly assesses whether the objectives and evaluation criteria established&#xD;
    in the Iteration Plan were met, and whether the team adhered to the plan and completed all of the work items committed&#xD;
    to the iteration. The team makes use of objective measures to the greatest extent possible. To assess that a given work&#xD;
    item is completed, the team ensures that the corresponding test cases were successfully run against it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The team prepares a demonstration of the features implemented at that point, so that during the iteration assessment&#xD;
    stakeholders can have a real sense of progress made. The team decides whether each developer should demonstrate the&#xD;
    features that they implemented, or if the project manager or senior developer demonstrates it all, with other team&#xD;
    members present to answer questions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to the demonstration,&amp;nbsp;prepare reports that show project status, such as work burndown and test case&#xD;
    reports.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These activities happen in preparation for the iteration assessment meeting with stakeholders that occurs on the last&#xD;
    day of the iteration.&#xD;

    The team should demonstrate the product to customer, end-users, and other &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/stakeholder.html&quot; guid=&quot;_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ&quot;>Stakeholder&lt;/a>s to collect their feedback,&#xD;
    or better yet, have end users to use the product themselves. This should be done throughout the iteration, or at least&#xD;
    in a separate session towards the end of the iteration (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/iteration_review.html&quot; guid=&quot;_FekBAC4IEdyhZrtGEIITGQ&quot;>Guideline: Iteration&#xD;

    requested changes and defects are recorded in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Work Items List&lt;/a>, so project&#xD;

    Review with the team the approach taken to development and collaboration, the effectiveness of the development&#xD;
    environment, the suitability of the working environment, and other factors. Discuss what things went well, what could&#xD;
    have gone better, and how things could be changed to deliver better results. Capture in the current Iteration Plan the&#xD;
    assessment results, stakeholder feedback, and actions to be taken to improve the development approach for the next&#xD;
    iteration. Record lessons learned in this iteration with a collection of lessons learned for the entire project.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Perform this step when the iteration review coincides with the end of the project. Involve the team and stakeholders in&#xD;
    a final assessment for project acceptance which, if successful, marks the point when the customer accepts ownership of&#xD;
    the software product. Complete the close-out of the project by disposing of the remaining assets and reassigning the&#xD;
    remaining staff.&#xD;
