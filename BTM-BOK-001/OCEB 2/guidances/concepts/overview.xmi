    About OCEB 2 examinations&#xD;

    Figure 1. OCEB 2 Certification&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The five OCEB 2 examinations and certifications mirror industry job roles, knowledge, and skills: Above the Fundamental&#xD;
    level, the program splits into a Business Track and a TechnicalTrack with an Intermediate and Advanced level in each.&#xD;
    This allows you identify and obtain a certification that corresponds to the position you hold, or the promotion that&#xD;
    you aspire to.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The group of experts from top BPM companies and well-known independent consultants who designed the OCEB and OCEB 2&#xD;
    topical coverage and wrote the questions for the set of examinations want peers and prospective employers to feel&#xD;
    confident about a certified candidateâ€™s ability to participate in or lead real-world initiatives in enterprise BPM. To&#xD;
    accomplish this, OCEB 2 tests not only a candidate's knowledge of the domain's standards (such as BPMN 2&amp;trade;, BMM, and&#xD;
    BPMM), but also aspects of the application of those standards in the field, and of industry best practices, over a wide&#xD;
    range of business process-related topics. All exam questions are multiple-choice. Skills are tested by asking a&#xD;
    question about a short scenario, presented in a few sentences or a small BPMN diagram.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Because the lower levels are prerequisite for higher-level certifications, lower-level material is not tested again&#xD;
    explicitly on the higher-level exams although it is likely to appear as context for a question at the higher level.&#xD;
    Consistent with this, you'll find that the difference between levels as you move up the OCEB examination series lies&#xD;
    not so much in the difficulty of the individual questions as in the scope of material they cover. We believe that the&#xD;
    range of material covered by the Intermediate and Advanced examinations in both tracks is extensive enough that mastery&#xD;
    is a significant accomplishment, and that practitioners who study for and attain the Intermediate (two examinations,&#xD;
    180 questions) and Advanced (three examinations, 270 questions) OCEB 2 certifications fully deserve the elite status&#xD;
    conferred by their accomplishment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Should I certify on business side, technical side or both?&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Our BPM experts designed the Fundamental certification to cover the skills and knowledge most-used in BPM, plus a set&#xD;
    of topics - such as governance and process quality frameworks - that come up frequently in conversations and&#xD;
    interactions in analysis and implementation of business processes. At the Intermediate and Advanced levels, there is&#xD;
    very little overlap of coverage between the two sides: BPMN coverage in the Business track concentrates on aspects and&#xD;
    constructs used to represent the As-Is process, analyze it, and build the To-Be process; moving beyond BPMN, the&#xD;
    business-side examinations cover business aspects of process analytics, process optimization, governance and regulatory&#xD;
    compliance, and the business side of many other topics. In contrast, the higher-level Technical Side examinations cover&#xD;
    advanced BPMN capabilities concentrating on the ability to read and implement complex BPMN models, including&#xD;
    familiarity with the van der Aalst workflow patters, topics in Business Rules, SOA, and MDA&amp;reg;; Privacy and Security&#xD;
    concerns, and Process Metrics from the technical point of view - that is, collecting information at the right places&#xD;
    and the right times for storage or display on a business dashboard.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    So - If you work exclusively on only one side - that is, Business or Technical, but not both - and you don't interact&#xD;
    much with people or projects on the other side, then certification in only one track may be enough for you. But if you&#xD;
    work at the intersection of business process analysis and automation, or concentrate on one side but interact with&#xD;
    people on the other, or if you're a consultant and use your comprehensive expertise to establish credibility with&#xD;
    clients, you should seriously consider certifying in both the Business and Technical tracks.&#xD;
