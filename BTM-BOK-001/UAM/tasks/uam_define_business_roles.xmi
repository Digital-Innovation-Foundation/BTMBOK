    This task finds and defines the Business Actors interacting with the system. Also, and very important, is the&#xD;
    definition of standard business vocabulary that is used to describe and discuss the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To find candidate Business Actors, examine the processes involved. At the Business level we only concern ourselves with&#xD;
    Actors, external actors, that interact with the system. Roles are not defined at this level since their definition has&#xD;
    implications: the activity is Manual or involves a User (i.e. the activity cannot be automated).&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>The Business Actors identified during this task are high-level, but their definition must be very precise, and agreed by&#xD;
stakeholders.</keyConsiderations>

    diagramdiagramdiagramdiagramdiagramBusiness Processes may provide useful input for the identifications of Business&#xD;
    Actors, but a very good source is the Context Diagram for the IT architecture. Other sources are as-is documentation of&#xD;
    the relevant business domains, processes&amp;nbsp;or systems, as the case may be for the scope in question. The example&#xD;
    below illustrates how business actors are identified in a Context Diagram.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
The actors identified in this example are a Customer, which is the actor that executes the Customer Profile, Access&#xD;
Information and Distribute Reports activities. The other actor identified is Partner, which interacts with the Gather &amp;amp;&#xD;
Analyze Information activity, in response to some trigger event. Finally a Research Customer actor interacts with the&#xD;
Manage Information Base and Perform Specialized Research activities.&lt;br /></sectionDescription>

    When you feel you have collected enough background information, it is time to describe the actors in detail.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt&quot;>&#xD;
    Start by arranging the actors in some sort of logical framework. For example, for a Bank that provides&amp;nbsp;Loan&#xD;
    Services, one actor would be &quot;Customer&quot; ... define &lt;i>one&lt;/i> for each type of&amp;nbsp;customer,&amp;nbsp;not one for each&#xD;
    physical instantiation. Likewise, examine the need for security domains and zones (see: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../UAM/guidances/whitepapers/uam_security_reference_model_3EA07B63.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_KGs_oMX8EdyDYN2-y9-AqA&quot;>Whitepaper: A Reference Model for Enterprise Security&lt;/a>),&amp;nbsp;which may be viewed as&#xD;
    the need for specific &quot;actors&quot;, for example a business's Internet presence may be viewed as a logical actor (&quot;Online&#xD;
    Banker&quot; for example)&amp;nbsp;accessible to all, whereas the business's Intranet will only be accessible by employees, a&#xD;
    &quot;teller banker&quot; for example.&#xD;

    Using the Process Model, or other sources of information, determine if there are interactions between actors. These&#xD;
    interactions, which are executed and supported through one or more business activities, should confirm the workflow&#xD;
    defined in the Business Process Model. Consult the Business Process Model to be sure that&amp;nbsp;all interactions are&#xD;
    defined and are consistent.&amp;nbsp;The objective is to understand how actors collaborate in executing business activity,&#xD;
    which will influence design choices later on.&#xD;
