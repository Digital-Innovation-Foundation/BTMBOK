    The enterprises IT Strategy is the overall plan which consists of objective(s), principles, and tactics relating to use&#xD;
    of the technologies within a particular organization. This strategy focuses on the technologies and their use within&#xD;
    the organization. They provide instructions, and constraints, for IT managers and experts when deciding on solutions&#xD;
    and investments.&amp;nbsp;The strategy is typically written down in a document. Also see: &lt;a&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Strategy defines the general direction that the enterprise is taking with respect to technology—some high-level&#xD;
    technology choices are defined. It should also have an assessment of general technology directions—indications of where&#xD;
    technology is going in the future and how the enterprise is to use it to advantage.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The IT Strategy defines constraints on the IT architecture that have to be addressed.&#xD;
