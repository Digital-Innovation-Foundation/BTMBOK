  <mainDescription>An actor, associated with a &quot;user&quot; (person) interacts with the &quot;system&quot; through one or more roles. A role&amp;nbsp;is equated&#xD;
to and defined by the behavior (and by extension the responsibilities) of&amp;nbsp;the associated activity. A role can be&#xD;
assumed by any kind of actor, either human or a system. An role may be associated with&amp;nbsp;only one activity, but there&#xD;
may be multiple roles associated with the activity.&amp;nbsp;An actor can be associated with&amp;nbsp;multiple physical people (or&#xD;
systems). &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Unified Architecture Method includes three levels of abstraction (perspectives) for actors and roles: Business,&#xD;
    Logical, and Technology.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This checklist defines things to look for when defining actors, to ensure that they are well-defined, that the model is&#xD;
    complete and that it is consistent.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>That is, have you accounted for and modeled all roles in the system's environment? Everything in the business environment&#xD;
interactions—both human and mechanical—is modeled with actors and associated roles. You cannot be sure of finding every&#xD;
actor until you have found and described every business activity/service. Each activity could have at least one&#xD;
direct&amp;nbsp;role associated, except at the Business Level where just actors are identified, in general (roles are defined&#xD;
at the Logical Level).</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Remove any roles (and possibly the actor) not mentioned&amp;nbsp;in or associated with a&amp;nbsp;business activity. Many&#xD;
    (most) activities have associated roles—ensure that roles have not been missed.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Actors require some sort of result (service) from the system, and therefore if there is a service provided and no actor&#xD;
    defined there is likely a problem. Each actor expresses an interaction (request for service) and is not associated with&#xD;
    a&amp;nbsp;specific person (and it may not actually be a person). You should be able to name at least two persons that can&#xD;
    play the role of each actor. If you can't, you may have modeled a person, not a actor and roles. Of course, there are&#xD;
    situations in which you can find only one person who can play a role. Each actor models something that interacts&#xD;
    with&amp;nbsp;business, either external (e.g. Customer) or internal (e.g., employee).&#xD;

role&amp;nbsp;names (verbs) correspond to and describe how they interact with the associated activity. If not, change them.</sectionDescription>
