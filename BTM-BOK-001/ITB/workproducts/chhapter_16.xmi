    Understanding Financial Management and Securities Markets&lt;br />&#xD;
    Learning Outcomes&lt;br />&#xD;
    After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    How do finance and the financial manager affect a firm’s overall strategy?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What types of short-term and long-term expenditures does a firm make?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the main sources and costs of unsecured and secured short-term financing?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the key differences between debt and equity, and what are the major types and features of long-term&#xD;
    debt?&lt;br />&#xD;
    When and how do firms issue equity, and what are the costs?&lt;br />&#xD;
    How do securities markets help firms raise funding, and what securities trade in the capital markets?&lt;br />&#xD;
    Where can investors buy and sell securities, and how are securities markets regulated?&lt;br />&#xD;
    What are the current developments in financial management and the securities markets?&lt;br />&#xD;
    In today’s fast-paced global economy, managing a firm’s finances is more complex than ever. For financial managers, a&#xD;
    thorough command of traditional finance activities—financial planning, investing money, and raising funds—is only part&#xD;
    of the job. Financial managers are more than number crunchers. As part of the top management team, chief financial&#xD;
    officers (CFOs) need a broad understanding of their firm’s business and industry, as well as leadership ability and&#xD;
    creativity. They must never lose sight of the primary goal of the financial manager: to maximize the value of the firm&#xD;
    to its owners.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Financial management—spending and raising a firm’s money—is both a science and an art. The science part is analyzing&#xD;
    numbers and flows of cash through the firm. The art is answering questions such as these: Is the firm using its&#xD;
    financial resources in the best way? Aside from costs, why choose a particular form of financing? How risky is each&#xD;
    option? Another important concern for both business managers and investors is understanding the basics of securities&#xD;
    markets and the securities traded on them, which affect both corporate plans and investor pocketbooks. About 52 percent&#xD;
    of adult Americans now own stocks, compared to just 25 percent in 1981.1&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This chapter focuses on the financial management of a firm and the securities markets in which firms raise funds. We’ll&#xD;
    start with an overview of the role of finance and of the financial manager in the firm’s overall business strategy.&#xD;
    Discussions of short- and long-term uses of funds and investment decisions follow. Next, we’ll examine key sources of&#xD;
    short- and long-term financing. Then we’ll review the function, operation, and regulation of securities markets.&#xD;
    Finally, we’ll look at key trends affecting financial management and securities markets.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    EXPLORING BUSINESS CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Vicki Saunders, Venture Capitalist &amp;amp; Entrepreneur&lt;br />&#xD;
    Many women dream of starting their own business. But this involves a large investment of time, dedication,&#xD;
    creativity—and money. Even the best ideas fall flat without strong financial backing and fiscal management. Most&#xD;
    start-ups don’t have a chief financial officer, let alone an unlimited amount of cash to fund their owners’ dreams.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    According to a recent report, there are more than 11 million woman-owned businesses in the United States that employ&#xD;
    close to 9 million people and generate more than $1.6 trillion in revenues. And revenues have increased for these&#xD;
    businesses more than 35% over the last decade compared to 27% among all U.S. companies. Despite these impressive&#xD;
    statistics, less than 4 percent of venture capital funding goes to this group of entrepreneurs. That’s where Vicki&#xD;
    Saunders and SheEO, her venture capital start-up, come into the picture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Saunders, who describes herself as a serial entrepreneur, previously cofounded and ran four different business&#xD;
    ventures. She believes that the funding universe for women entrepreneurs needs to be fixed and offers her plan via&#xD;
    SheEO, a platform to enlist women “activators” to invest money to create a pool of capital distributed to select&#xD;
    woman-owned businesses in the form of 0% interest loans that are paid back within five years. The activators are more&#xD;
    than just investors, however. Saunders envisions these women as being a crucial part of the businesses in which they&#xD;
    invest, by providing operational support, resources for suppliers and other vendors, and a solid networking opportunity&#xD;
    for everything from legal support to cultivating new customers. In a recent campaign called Radical Generosity, $1,000&#xD;
    was raised from each of 500 women, and that pool of $500,000 was split among five woman-led businesses.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In year three of the funding venture in 2017, SheEO funded 15 companies and invested $1.5 million. SheEO has funded&#xD;
    entrepreneurs working on a variety of businesses, including artificial intelligence, hardware for people with&#xD;
    disabilities, food, and education. While SheEO currently operates in four regions, Canada, Los Angeles, San Francisco,&#xD;
    and Colorado, Saunders’s goals for funding woman-led businesses are lofty. By 2020, Saunders hopes to have a million&#xD;
    investors and a billion dollars to fund 10,000 entrepreneurs. But her ultimate goal is to change the culture around how&#xD;
    investors support businesses—all businesses. According to Saunders, activating women on behalf of other women will&#xD;
    change the world.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
