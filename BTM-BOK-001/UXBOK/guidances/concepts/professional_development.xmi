  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usability is a profession that attracts people with extremely varied backgrounds. Many people want to know how to make&#xD;
    the transition into usability by drawing on their previous experience in a related field, or what educational&#xD;
    opportunities are available to people just starting out as usability practitioners. Experienced practitioners may be&#xD;
    considering their career path, and managers want to provide opportunities for their employees to learn new skills.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Continued learning and professional training are essential for continual growth in the evolving field of usability. To&#xD;
    address this need, the UPA is looking for the best way to present resources that are relevant to both students and&#xD;
    professionals looking to enhance their knowledge of this growing field.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Academic Programs&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Degree programs in usability, human-computer interaction (HCI), human factors, interaction design, and others are&#xD;
    increasingly available, along with individual courses available from various universities.&#xD;
