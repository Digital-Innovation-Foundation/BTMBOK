  <mainDescription>&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Organization of Decisions&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The enterprise that owns the Architectural Decisions will need to decide how they are to be classified and organized&#xD;
    for easy search and retrieval by&amp;nbsp;architects, designers and implementation people. Although the creation and&#xD;
    storage of Architecture Decisions is currently outside the scope of UAM, one suggestion is that they be organized in a&#xD;
    widely available searchable repository on the corporate Intranet. It could also be implemented as a segmented area&#xD;
    within the corporate document management facility.&amp;nbsp;This will facilitate their distribution and use by all&#xD;
    architects, project managers and implementers within the organization. The repository&amp;nbsp;will promote easy compliance&#xD;
    to enterprise and business domain standards, with all the benefits that follow. Having a well defined template and&#xD;
    process that is supported through tools will allow for the easy creation, management and use of ADs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Contents&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    ADs contain a lot of background and substantiating information. This is very useful if the decision needs to be&#xD;
    re-visited in the future, however, most users of this information (i.e., architects, project managers, and&#xD;
    implementers) are only interested in the decision itself. Therefore when a set of applicable (to an&#xD;
    IT&amp;nbsp;architecture project) ADs is found, a summary report should be provided to the user of the repository that&#xD;
    defines each decision, leaving out all of the extraneous supporting information. The specific AD can be examined in&#xD;
    total if more information is required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Integration with architecture development tools and system development and implementation&amp;nbsp;tools would be an asset.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The &lt;a id=&quot;XE_Architectural_Decision__Repository&quot; name=&quot;XE_Architectural_Decision__Repository&quot;>Decisions&lt;/a> Repository&#xD;
    stores all architectural decisions (AD) of the enterprise, regardless as to whether they are enterprise level&#xD;
    decisions, business domain level decisions or lower level decisions. The repository is an enterprise level resource&#xD;
    that is used by all architects, designers, implementers and project managers in the enterprise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on the size of&amp;nbsp;the organization&amp;nbsp;there could be multiple repositories geographically distributed,&#xD;
    however&amp;nbsp;it is used and viewed as a&amp;nbsp;single logical repository. The number of documents in the repository&#xD;
    should be relatively low, but they need to be organized and searchable by users.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is recommended that this repository also be used to store and make available &quot;design decisions&quot; that are made within&#xD;
    implementation projects. Similarly, if there are any &quot;business level&quot; decisions (that are not Architectural Decisions)&#xD;
    then they should also be stored and tracked.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The AD repository is not a critical part of the enterprise infrastructure and as such can be on any server, however it&#xD;
    is an important resource. The data volumes are low as well as the numbers of queries expected. However, the repository&#xD;
    must be available to all architects, project managers, analysts and implementers across the enterprise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The repository, in addition to tracking the ADs as they proceed through the process, provides the ability to get&#xD;
    summary reports (e.g. The number of ADs awaiting CIO review, or a summary description report of the all &quot;Approved&quot; ADs,&#xD;
    etc.) and to search for ADs. All ADs created are retained in &lt;em>one&lt;/em> repository regardless of their point of&#xD;
    origin or state. ADs are only deleted when they have been replaced through the creation of new ADs, or the AD is no&#xD;
    longer valid because the system or function to which it applies has been retired.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An AD MS Word template (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../UAM/guidances/templates/uam_architectural_decision_A2190D71.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_kTjToMKyEdy4DtCs1YI90Q&quot;>Template: Architectural Decision Template&lt;/a>) is used to capture the required&#xD;
    information quickly and easily. The template, along with &quot;attributes&quot; for each AD, permits the searching for and&#xD;
    reporting on ADs and on metrics for the process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt&quot;>&#xD;
    ADs within the repository will be identified as an &quot;AD&quot; type. The following attributes for ADs are suggested to aid in&#xD;
    their tracking:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Priority&lt;/b> - The priority of the AD: &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot; or Low&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Domain&lt;/b> - The business domain that originated the AD (i.e. CIO, CORP, or 'Business Domain x')&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;b>State&lt;/b> - The state of the AD within the process (i.e. RFC, 'Business Domain x', CIO, Review, Escalate,&#xD;
        Approved or Rejected)&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Type&lt;/b> - The type of AD, that is, the architectural area or speciality that the AD is concerned with (This&#xD;
        will aid in identifying the kinds of specialists involved with the review of the AD), namely:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Software,&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Hardware,&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Business Architecture,&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Application Architecture,&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Integration Architecture,&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Storage Architecture,&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Information Architecture,&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Security Architecture, and&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Infrastructure Architecture&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>&lt;em>Note:&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> The AD repository should maintain &lt;em>author&lt;/em>, &lt;em>revision&lt;/em> and &lt;em>date&lt;/em>&#xD;
    information automatically.&#xD;
&lt;/p></representationOptions>
