    What is PM² Methodology?
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    PM² is a Project Management Methodology developed by the European Commission. Its purpose is to enable Project Managers
    (PMs) to deliver solutions and benefits to their organisations by effectively managing the entire lifecycle of their
    project. PM² has been created with the needs of European Union Institutions and projects in mind, but is transferrable
    to projects in any organisation.
&lt;/p>
&lt;br />
&lt;br />
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    PM² is a light and easy-to-implement methodology which project teams can tailor to their specific needs. PM² is fully
    supported by a comprehensive training programme (including workshops and coaching sessions), online documentation and
    an active Community of Practice (currently only available within the European Commission and to a number of affiliate
    European Institutions).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    PM² incorporates elements from a wide range of globally accepted project management best practices, captured in
    standards and methodologies. Its development has also been influenced by operational experience on various projects
    both within European Union Institutions and external bodies.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h5>
    What does the PM² Methodology provide to its users?
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The adoption of the PM² Guide allows project professionals access the following tools:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            a project governance structure
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            process guidelines
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            artefact templates
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            guidelines for using the artefacts
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>
            a set of effective mindsets
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h5>
