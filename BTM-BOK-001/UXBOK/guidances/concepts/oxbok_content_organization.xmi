    How is UXBOK organized?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Content pages are organized to be useful to a wide range of users. They provide a definition and simple overview to the&#xD;
    topic, as well as linked references to the most important information about that topic that is available on the Web or&#xD;
    in print. They can also contain additional detail that is useful for specific audiences, or to explore questions that&#xD;
    are a source of active debate within the profession.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Because of the way that Usability BoK content is managed using a database, it is possible in the future to use&#xD;
    particular chunks of content from a Topic page. For example, if a user indicates that they are an HR manager or&#xD;
    journalist, rather than a usability practitioner, they may have the option to see only the 'overview' (title,&#xD;
    definition, and simple description) for each Topic, as a way of matching the content to their experience and need for&#xD;
    information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Here is an illustration of the main elements of content within each topic page:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Can 'Authoritative' and 'Contributed' Content Co-exist in a Living Model?&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The above content model has some interesting attributes in our community-collaborative world. It helps resolve the&#xD;
    tensions between:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;strong>A strong editorial process&lt;/strong>, creating an authoritative/definitive 'Body of Knowledge' that can&#xD;
            support activities like professional development and certification within the profession, as well as acting as&#xD;
            a consistent reference for people outside the profession.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;strong>A community collaborative process&lt;/strong>, creating a living, dynamic reference guide that keeps the&#xD;
            profession relevant to the social and organizational contexts in which it operates, and maintains information&#xD;
            over time.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The content model provides a lightweight segmentation of content between the authoritative 'overview' and the&#xD;
    potentially more dynamic 'detail'. While the current features don't include specific implementation of that editorial&#xD;
    segmentation, it is something to consider as part of the technology roadmap going forward, if it is considered valuable&#xD;
    by the Association and the user community.&lt;br />&#xD;
