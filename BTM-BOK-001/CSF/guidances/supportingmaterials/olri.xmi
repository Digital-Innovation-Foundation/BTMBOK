    Planning Note (8/4/2020):&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NIST is seeking public comments on two draft NISTIRs for the National Cybersecurity Online Informative References&#xD;
    (OLIR) Program. This Program is a NIST effort to facilitate subject matter experts in defining standardized Online&#xD;
    Informative References (OLIRs), which are relationships between elements of their documents and elements of other&#xD;
    documents like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.&amp;nbsp; The draft reports focus on 1) OLIR program overview and uses&#xD;
    (NISTIR 8278), and 2) submission guidance for OLIR developers (NISTIR 8278A).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Draft (2nd) NISTIR 8278 describes the OLIR Program: what OLIRs are, what benefits they provide, how anyone can search&#xD;
    and access OLIRs, and how subject matter experts can contribute OLIRs. Based on feedback received from early adopters&#xD;
    as well as discussions at the December 2019 OLIR workshop, this second draft includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The introduction of two new Focal Document Templates:&lt;br />&#xD;
    Privacy Framework: A Tool for Improving Privacy through Enterprise Risk Management v1.0, and&lt;br />&#xD;
    Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and&#xD;
    Organizations&lt;br />&#xD;
    New functional enhancements to the OLIR Catalog and Derived Relationships Mapping (DRM) display tool&lt;br />&#xD;
    NOTE: A call for patent claims is included on page iv of this draft. For additional information, see the Information&#xD;
    Technology Laboratory (ITL) Patent Policy--Inclusion of Patents in ITL Publications.&#xD;

    Abstract&lt;br />&#xD;
    The National Cybersecurity Online Informative References (OLIR) Program is a NIST effort to facilitate subject matter&#xD;
    experts in defining standardized Online Informative References (OLIRs), which are relationships between elements of&#xD;
    their documents and elements of other documents like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The OLIR Program provides a&#xD;
    standard format for expressing OLIRs as well as a centralized location for displaying them. This report describes the&#xD;
    OLIR Program, focusing on explaining what OLIRs are, what benefits they provide, how anyone can search and access&#xD;
    OLIRs, and how subject matter experts can contribute OLIRs.&lt;br />&#xD;
