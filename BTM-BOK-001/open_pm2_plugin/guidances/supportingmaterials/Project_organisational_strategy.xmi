    What is a project?
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>
    A project is a temporary organisational structure set up to create a unique product or service (output) within certain
    constraints such as time, cost and quality.
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Temporary&lt;/strong> means that the project has a well-defined start and end.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Unique&lt;/strong> output means that the project’s product or service has not been created before. It may be
        similar to another product, but there will always be a degree of uniqueness.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        A project’s output may be a &lt;strong>product&lt;/strong> (e.g. a new application) or a &lt;strong>service&lt;/strong> (e.g. a
        consulting service, a conference or a training programme).
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    The project is defined, planned and executed under certain external (or self-imposed) &lt;strong>constraints&lt;/strong>.
    These can relate to scheduling, budgeting, quality, but also to the project’s organizational environment (e.g. risk
    attitude, capabilities, available capacity, etc.)
&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    A successful project ends when its objectives have been achieved and all deliverables have been produced and accepted
    by the organisation or person that requested the project (the client). The deliverables are then handed over to the
    client and the project team is disbanded.&lt;br />
    Projects are different from normal day-to-day work (operations) and one best managed with a special temporary
    organisational structure in order to:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        define the project scope and its deliverables (products or services)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        create a business justification for the investment (by defining the project’s value for the organisation, outlining
        the business context, listing alternative solutions, etc.)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        identify project stakeholders and define a project core team
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        create the project plans to help guide and manage the project
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        assign and coordinate project work to teams
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        monitor and control the project daily (progress, changes, risks, issues, quality, etc.)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        hand over the deliverables and administratively close the project.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

    &lt;strong>What is a PM² Project?&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Many PM² best practices can be applied to any type of project or work activity. However, to be able to apply the whole
    PM² Methodology, a project must have certain characteristics.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &amp;nbsp;Thus, a PM² project:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        is (above all) a project (i.e. not operations, not a work activity, not a programme, etc.)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        has a duration of more than 4–5 weeks and involves more than 2–3 people
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        runs within an organisation and can be subject to internal or external audits
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        requires a clearly defined governance structure and clearly assigned roles and responsibilities
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        requires approval of its budget and scope
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        includes more than just construction/delivery activities
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        includes transition and business implementation activities
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        requires a certain level of documentation, transparency and reporting
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        requires a certain level of control and traceability
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        has a broad base of internal (and external) stakeholders
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        may require the collaboration of several organisations or organisational units
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        contributes to raising the organisation’s project management maturity.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    The number of the above characteristics, apparent in a project, drive the tailoring and customization that will have to
    be applied to the PM2 methodology.
