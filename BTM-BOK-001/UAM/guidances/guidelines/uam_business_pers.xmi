&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Perspective defines the business level view of the system. The various viewpoints defined show&amp;nbsp;how&#xD;
    people (actors)&amp;nbsp;interact with processes at various locations within the business, and the things they handle and&#xD;
    use (business entities). The models also show how these different aspects and things must relate to one another, both&#xD;
    statically and dynamically, to produce the&amp;nbsp;desired business results. It places emphasis on the identification of&#xD;
    entities, actors, the business locations and processes, and their active responsibilities. The viewpoints show all&#xD;
    collaborations (relationships)&amp;nbsp;needed to support business activities, and all classes (the static view of&#xD;
    entities) from which objects (operational instances) will be instantiated to obtain the desired business results for&#xD;
    the various business roles.&#xD;

    The key elements of the Business Perspective, summarized in the figure above, are:&#xD;

        guid=&quot;_0q0KgM56Edymj4NXv8-FYA&quot;>Business Activities&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;show how business processes, tasks,&amp;nbsp;business&#xD;
        entities and business events and rules work together to perform a business activity. Events and Rules are captured&#xD;
        in the Business Process Model.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#xD;

        responsibilities based upon a conceptual view of the system's conceptual geography. They encapsulate their&#xD;
        resources, and provide services through well-defined interfaces, to other parts of the system.&#xD;

        guid=&quot;_uByisM5nEdymj4NXv8-FYA&quot;>Business Role&lt;/a>s are the active units of a business, they represent an abstraction&#xD;
        of a human interface (GUI) or software interface.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Perspective is documented&amp;nbsp;in four viewpoints, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    modeling language defined, integrated into the Perspective Viewpoint Language, see: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following are some characteristics of the Business Perspective:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is a bridging artifact that articulates business concerns and requirements, using business language and&#xD;
        concepts, but in a way that is useful to IT architects. It is a reflection back to business managers, using formal&#xD;
        constructs, of the area of business of interest.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It explores the essence of the system (or enterprise or business domains) in a way that provides a transition from&#xD;
        thinking about business issues to thinking about information technology.&amp;nbsp;Model concepts and&#xD;
        constructs&amp;nbsp;provide the formalisms necessary for architects to do this translation, but in a way that is&#xD;
        consumable by business managers.&amp;nbsp;Computational aspects (such as &lt;em>storage&lt;/em>) are absent from the Business&#xD;
        Model.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is a way of firming up business concepts, requirements and strategies to be enabled or supported by information&#xD;
        technologies. Understanding the implications of these strategies, plans or goals on the&amp;nbsp;IT architecture is a&#xD;
        major goal&amp;nbsp;for IT architects.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A very important aspect of doing IT architecture is agreeing business object definitions, relationships between&#xD;
        objects, and the names for the objects. This permits business knowledge to be represented in a precise manner that&#xD;
        can be understood and validated by business domain experts, but in a way that is very useful to architects. Also&#xD;

    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>&lt;u>Note&lt;/u>:&lt;/strong> Since&amp;nbsp;UAM looks at the complete system&amp;nbsp;(or enterprise or business domain),&#xD;
        the level of detail to be included in this model is a judgment call of the architect, based upon:&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In general, Business Entities, Business Activities, Business Locations, and Business Actors/Roles should have short,&#xD;
    descriptive names that are unique and recognizable.&amp;nbsp;Multiple word names are acceptable for clarity, but multiple&#xD;
    names for the same thing (an entity, location, activity or actor) is a &lt;em>major&lt;/em> problemâ€”therefore, if there is&#xD;
    some contention regarding a name/definition, work through it until a single name and definition is agreed, or multiple&#xD;
    things are identified and defined.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Entities are named&amp;nbsp;to reflect the information they represent. As mentioned they must be defined in the&#xD;
    Business Glossary (along with the activities, locations and roles), since there are always differences of opinion&#xD;
    regarding definitions, and relationships as well. The state, or other properties of a Business Entity, should not be&#xD;
    included in its name. Business Entity names should be singular nouns. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_business_entity_8BB65862.html&quot; guid=&quot;_gVpMsORpEdy7f9KmjDtwsA&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Business Entity&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_MYViYOS5EdyYxtlRIMoTnw&quot;>Guideline: Business Entity Model&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Activities, at the enterprise architecture level, encompass a number of processes and tasks; the names should&#xD;
    reflect these processes and tasks, &lt;em>Human Resources Management&lt;/em> for example. It is better to be more specific&#xD;
    and explicit in early iterations&amp;nbsp;that trying to attempt to develop generalized models from the start. One can&#xD;
    always return to a model and adjust as necessary to add generalizations, or likewise specializations.&#xD;
    Generally,&amp;nbsp;the active form of&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;verb is useful (such as &lt;em>Shipping&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Invoicing&lt;/em>, or&#xD;
    &lt;em>Selling&lt;/em>) as is a reference to the purpose of the Business Activity. See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_business_activity_4D5EB1E9.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_q2cJkOR3Edy7f9KmjDtwsA&quot;>Guideline: Business Activity&lt;/a> and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_HHxlUOSFEdy7f9KmjDtwsA&quot;>Guideline: Business Process Model&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Locations are named&amp;nbsp;to reflect the generic / conceptual location that they represent. Business Location&#xD;
    names should be singular nouns, such as &lt;em>Factory&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Warehouse&lt;/em>, &lt;em>ATM&lt;/em>, for example. See: &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_business_location_4488DF4B.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_h4H5AOSeEdyYxtlRIMoTnw&quot;>Guideline: Business Location&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_LEYwkOSgEdyYxtlRIMoTnw&quot;>Guideline: Business Locations Model&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Actor names reflect the primary activities that they interact with. Note that at the business&amp;nbsp;level it&#xD;
    should not be assumed that a actor/role will equate to a human, even if that is the current situation.&amp;nbsp;The name&#xD;
    should reflect&amp;nbsp;the role played by the business actor with the business activity.&amp;nbsp; For example, imagine a&#xD;
    business activity&amp;nbsp;in which an entity is submitted to and checked by one actor and then eventually processed and&#xD;
    finalized by a second business actor (such as&amp;nbsp;purchase order eventually being filled). The business actor who&#xD;
    checks the order (against inventory etc.) could be named&amp;nbsp;Order Reception, whereas the second business actor could&#xD;
    be named Order Fulfillment. Having the actor sounding human is pre-supposing the eventual solution. These decisions&#xD;
    should be deferred until later in the architecture process.&amp;nbsp;See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_user-actor-role_8210ACA7.html&quot; guid=&quot;_r8jW8OPQEdy7f9KmjDtwsA&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Events and Rules are optional, but very useful&amp;nbsp;when defining an enterprise architecture.&amp;nbsp;Events&#xD;
    should be named in a way that indicates the occurrence or state change that it representsâ€”in other words, they&#xD;
    generally have a business entity part and a business action part, for example &lt;em>Order&lt;/em>&lt;em>Arrival&lt;/em>. Do not&#xD;
    describe the reaction to the event in the name. The specification of the event is also&amp;nbsp;independent of its&#xD;
    triggers. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_business_event_82E69349.html&quot; guid=&quot;_sWMqgE13EeOcVJX_gvTjyg&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Business Event&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Business Entities in Relation to Business Activities&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;Business Entities in Relation to Business Activities&quot;>Business Entities and Business&amp;nbsp;Activities&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you study the business actors and business entities that participate in business activities, you may find several&#xD;
    that are so similar that they are really one. Even when different business activities do not have identical demands,&#xD;
    they may be similar enough to be considered one and the same phenomenon. If this is the case, merge the similar&#xD;
    activities into one. This results in a business actor or business entity that has the relationships, attributes, and&#xD;
    operations to meet the demands of the different business activities.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Several business activities may, therefore, have quite different demands&amp;nbsp;on the same entity or actor. In the case&#xD;
    of business actors/roles, if you have employees capable of acting in the extended role(s), you will need to have&#xD;
    flexible employees who can work in several capacities. This gives you a more flexible business, if this extension to&#xD;
    their responsibilities is possible and desirable. This should be documented in an architectural decision.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;The Business Analysis Model and Information Systems&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;The Business Analysis Model and Information Systems&quot;>The Business Perspective and Information Systems&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Business Perspective, Business Actors describe the external interactions, whereas Business Entities represent&#xD;
    those things that are produced and consumed by the activities. The Business Perspective defines how the Business&#xD;
    Activities and Business Entities need to interact to produce the desired results for the Business Role and Actor. A&#xD;
    Business Actor/Role may represent an abstraction of an automated system interaction; this automation (or not) is&#xD;
    defined at the Logical and Technical Perspective levels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Perspective and Logical Perspective address the same problem&amp;nbsp;domain at two different abstraction&#xD;
    levels. Therefore, these different views need to remain consistent, for example logical modeling details and concepts&#xD;
    (like &lt;em>storage&lt;/em>) should not appear in the business level models.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you examine the interactions and characteristics of business roles in the 'as-is' model (particularly those roles&#xD;
    played by human workers), the occurrence and consumption of business events, and the operations performed on business&#xD;
    entities, certain relationship heuristics between the Business and Logical Perspective modeling contexts may be useful,&#xD;
    as you look for automation opportunities. Links, associations and attributes in the Business Perspective may suggest&#xD;
    possible automation:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When the business activities are large, long-lived, or combine work from several independent areas (as is the case&#xD;
        for many enterprise architecture business activities) then the System Model view of the activity will likely have&#xD;
        many Logical Processes / Tasks&amp;nbsp;in its model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The things the business activities manipulatedâ€”modeled as business entitiesâ€”have representations in the Logical&#xD;
        Perspective.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business events are often implemented as messages&amp;nbsp;between Tasks in process at the Logical Perspective level.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Associations between business entities often give rise to corresponding associations between entity classes in the&#xD;
        Logical Entity Model, but perhaps in a more specific way (i.e. as generalizations, aggregations, etc.).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Logical Activities&amp;nbsp;that manipulate Logical Entity classes in the Logical Perspective are&#xD;
        represented&amp;nbsp;by Business Entities accessed by Business Activities in the Business Perspective .&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A&amp;nbsp;business actor/role that directly uses a business activity also becomes a logical actor of the&amp;nbsp;logical&#xD;
        activity&amp;nbsp;in the Logical Perspective context.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These relationships are&amp;nbsp;useful when identifying requirements for the logical systems to support the business&#xD;
    model.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you model manipulations of business entities by business roles, it is evident that many of the operations on the&#xD;
    business entities would be performed with the assistance of some toolâ€”perhaps computer-based. This is &lt;em>not&lt;/em>&#xD;
    explicitly modeled as a&amp;nbsp;type of&amp;nbsp;information technology within the business model since it is conceptually&#xD;
    out-of-scope. As mentioned above, notion of computing and technology (technology solutions) do not belong in the&#xD;
    business level models. These automation and technology decisions are made when modeling the Logical and Technical&#xD;
    Perspectives.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;Information Systems as Business Actors&quot; name=&quot;Information Systems as Business Actors&quot;>Systems as Business&#xD;
    Actors&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes the employees of one business contact the employees of another business through the use of an information&#xD;
    system in the first business, from the perspective of the modeled business (receiving the request), that information&#xD;
    system is a business actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    A software developer tries to understand a problem in the product for which he is responsible. To understand if the&#xD;
    problem originates from the programming tool he is using, he contacts the programming tool supplier's World Wide Web&#xD;
    server and studies the list of known problems in the current release of the tool. In this way, the business actor&#xD;
    &lt;em>Software Developer&lt;/em> interacts with the business actor &lt;em>Supplier WWW Server&lt;/em>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Understanding the Business&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    The following assumes that there is no pre-existing architecture work or models completed.&amp;nbsp;If you want to effect&#xD;
    change in a business you have to know it well.&amp;nbsp;Knowledge will assist the architecture team in making sound&#xD;
    decisions when defining the architecture,&amp;nbsp;and help to establish a relationship of trust with business&#xD;
    people.&amp;nbsp;The inclusion of business people on the architecture team is a valid approach (a must) but is not&#xD;
    enough.&amp;nbsp;Specific business participants may have a limited or a skewed view of the business.&amp;nbsp;The architecture&#xD;
    team must have a reasonable understanding themselves, and the domain architect must have an excellent understanding of&#xD;
    the business.&amp;nbsp;How can this knowledge be acquired?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Start with a top-down approach to analyzing the business. Kick off the architecture effort by meeting with key&#xD;
            sponsors and stakeholders. It is necessary to understand the background and the objectives of the architecture&#xD;
            effort.&amp;nbsp;If the business has gone through a strategic planning exercise or has a Business Motivation Model&#xD;
            then review these documents.&amp;nbsp;The architecture team must have a solid understanding of the business vision&#xD;
            including the motivation for the architecture effort and a general idea of scope boundaries at the outset. To&#xD;
            further refine scope, analyze the organization chart. Understand the principle job descriptions and attempt to&#xD;
            put a boundary around the parts of the organization that apply to the effort.&amp;nbsp;Compile a list of services&#xD;
            and products delivered by the business and place a boundary around this list.&amp;nbsp;Understand the clients of&#xD;
            the business and those that apply to the architecture effort.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Take a first cut at defining the scope with a context diagram and bounded organization chart in order to try to&#xD;
            contain the exploratory and interview effort.&amp;nbsp;Review this and the next steps in the exploratory process&#xD;
            with the sponsors and stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            From this analysis, you should now be able to compile a list of job titles of people within the business that&#xD;
            you would want to meet with either as a group session or individually.&amp;nbsp;If time permits, individual&#xD;
            interviews are much more effective for exploration.&amp;nbsp;There are several reasons for this, the most important&#xD;
            is that groups can be dominated by a single personâ€™s or a few peopleâ€™s opinions.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Before meeting with people within the organization obtain permission from senior managers. Explain the time&#xD;
            needed, the purpose of the meeting(s), the characteristics of a good participant and obtain the names of&#xD;
            potential interview candidates. The ideal participant will know their job function well, will have preferably&#xD;
            worked in other parts of the business, learns quickly, has a positive attitude and can think outside the box.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Throughout the whole exploration process, find the champions and the decision makers as well as good candidates&#xD;
            for inclusion on the architecture team (i.e., business representatives).&amp;nbsp;Having good decision makers will&#xD;
            ensure the stability and quality of the decisions made and of the architecture.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Review any policy / procedure manuals prior to the interviews. You must understand the business language before&#xD;
            one-on-one interviews.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Prepare interview questions.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Now the bottom-up analysis begins with preferably individual interviews.&amp;nbsp;You can use group sessions if you&#xD;
            must due to time considerations.&amp;nbsp;Be flexible during the interview process.&amp;nbsp;Remember that the purpose&#xD;
            is to understand the end-to-end process for the delivery of a service, to understand why things are done a&#xD;
            certain way and to drive out the â€˜trueâ€™ business rules and key practices.&amp;nbsp;Note that there are likely many&#xD;
            rules and practices that are a function of the present environment.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Job shadowing is another excellent technique for understanding what is being done first hand.&amp;nbsp;Often seeing&#xD;
            a task performed is more realistic than interviews or group sessions.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Gather some input and service time measurements from existing reports. If none exist, then it may be necessary&#xD;
            to do some data mining.&amp;nbsp;You will need the assistance of the current IT staff to help gather the necessary&#xD;
            information.&amp;nbsp;Architectural decisions cannot be made without an understanding of the volumes of input&#xD;
            requests and the volumes going through each task performed.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            &amp;nbsp;Once the business models are prepared from the exploratory work, the same people that were involved in&#xD;
            the exploratory sessions should be involved in a group review.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    Business Decisions&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many business decisions need to be made while defining an IT architecture. These decision, made by business people,&#xD;
    shape the resulting architecture. Advice regarding these decisions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make sure the right people are in the room.&amp;nbsp;Choose representatives from the business that are empowered to&#xD;
        make decisions. On projects that change the business substantially this will generally require senior managers;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Track all decisions carefully:&amp;nbsp; who was present, discussion points and dates, final decision and dates, attach&#xD;
        research and background material, the final record of decision (containing description of the problem, options&#xD;
        analysis, recommendation, sign-off);&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Remind representatives of decisions taken at the previous meeting and obtain sign-off;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Record decisions in a database that is indexed, can be searched easily by keyword / date.&amp;nbsp;This is needed down&#xD;
        the road when newcomers are trying to understand why certain decisions were made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Discourage decision makers from changing their minds all the timeâ€”the occasional change in opinion is typical but&#xD;
        if decisions arenâ€™t stable a project cannot move forward&amp;nbsp;since many decisions build on other fundamental&#xD;
        decisions.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Characteristics of a Good Enterprise Business Model&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;Characteristics of a Good Enterprise Business Model&quot;>Characteristics of a Good Business Perspective&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business events (and rules), business actors/roles, business entities, business activities and business locations&#xD;
    collectively completely describe&amp;nbsp;the system, no more and no less. The Business Perspective viewpoints provide a&#xD;
    good, comprehensive picture of the system at an appropriate level of abstraction, appropriate for the objective of the&#xD;
    modeling, and the size of the organization being modeled.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Transition to the Logical Perspective&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Logical Perspective is the evolution of the Business Perspective with choices (and associated rationale) for the&#xD;
    transformation/realization. Some refactoring, of Business Entities, Activities, Locations and Processes may be done,&#xD;
    adding more detail (as needed) to describe the system at the logical level. Computational aspects are also added.&#xD;
