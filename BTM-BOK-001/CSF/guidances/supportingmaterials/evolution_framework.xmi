    NIST developed the voluntary Framework in a manner consistent with its mission to promote U.S. innovation and&#xD;
    industrial competitiveness. The Framework has been developed and promoted through ongoing engagement with, and input&#xD;
    from, stakeholders in government, industry, and academia. That includes an open public review and comment process,&#xD;
    workshops and other means of engagement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 - Released&lt;br />&#xD;
    April 16, 2018&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Framework has evolved to be even more informative, useful, and inclusive for all kinds of organizations. Version&#xD;
    1.1 is fully compatible with Version 1.0 and remains flexible, voluntary, and cost-effective. Among other refinements&#xD;
    and enhancements, this version provides a more comprehensive treatment of identity management and additional&#xD;
    description of how to manage supply chain cybersecurity.&#xD;

    Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.0 - Released&lt;br />&#xD;
    February 12, 2014&lt;br />&#xD;
    To help organizations charged with providing the nation's financial, energy, health care and other critical systems&#xD;
    better protect their information and physical assets from cyber attack, the Commerce Department's National Institute of&#xD;
    Standards and Technology (NIST) released a Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. The framework&#xD;
    provides a structure that organizations, regulators and customers can use to create, guide, assess or improve&#xD;
    comprehensive cybersecurity programs.&#xD;

    July 1, 2013&lt;br />&#xD;
    The Preliminary Framework was developed by NIST using information collected through the Request for Information (RFI)&#xD;
    that was published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2013 and a series of open public workshops. The Preliminary&#xD;
    Framework was developed in response to Executive Order 13636, &quot;Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity&quot;&#xD;
    (&quot;Executive Order&quot;). Under the Executive Order, the Secretary of Commerce is tasked to direct the Director of NIST to&#xD;
    work with stakeholders to develop a framework to reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure.&#xD;

    EO 13636 outlined responsibilities for Federal Departments and Agencies to aid in Improving Critical Infrastructure&#xD;
    Cybersecurity. It assigned these responsibilities and established the policy that, &quot;It is the policy of the United&#xD;
    States to enhance the security and resilience of the Nation's critical infrastructure and to maintain a cyber&#xD;
    environment that encourages efficiency, innovation, and economic prosperity while promoting safety, security, business&#xD;
    confidentiality, privacy, and civil liberties.&quot;&#xD;
