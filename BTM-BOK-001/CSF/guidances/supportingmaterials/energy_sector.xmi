  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    When the lights dim due to a disruption in power generation or distribution, our productivity and quality of life do,&#xD;
    too. Energy is an absolutely critical infrastructure element for the nation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In July 2013, after consultation with energy company IT security professionals, the NCCoE posted drafts of the first of&#xD;
    several use cases addressing cybersecurity issues that are relevant across the energy sector. Find out more about the&#xD;
    resulting projects below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Securing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)&lt;br />&#xD;
    An approach for improving the overall security of information exchanges between and among distributed energy resource&#xD;
    systems and electric power distribution facilities. Learn more about this project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Asset Management&lt;br />&#xD;
    To properly assess cybersecurity risk within the operational technology network, energy companies must be able to&#xD;
    identify all their assets, especially the most critical. Learn more about this project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identity and Access Management (IdAM)&lt;br />&#xD;
    A centralized system to authenticate individuals' access to IT and operational resources and systems and control their&#xD;
    access with a high degree of certainty. Learn more about the project and download the NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide&#xD;
    1800-2.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Situational Awareness&lt;br />&#xD;
    Mechanisms to capture, transmit, analyze, and store real-time and near-real-time data across energy companiesâ€™&#xD;
    networked systems. Learn more about the project and download the NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide 1800-7.&#xD;
