    UAM defines IT Architectures as an organized set of three perspectives, each of which contain four viewpoints, with&#xD;
    each viewpoint containing elements that clear relationships to one another. Each perspective addresses the six&#xD;
    interrogatives (i.e., &lt;em>who&lt;/em>, &lt;em>what&lt;/em>, &lt;em>when&lt;/em>, &lt;em>where&lt;/em>, &lt;em>why&lt;/em> and &lt;em>how&lt;/em>) and&#xD;
    therefore the four viewpoints together form a complete model of the &quot;system&quot;. In UAM there are three perspectives, or&#xD;
    layers, used to describe the IT architecture—the Business Perspective, the Logical Perspective and the Technical&#xD;
    Perspective. Each of these perspectives (and their set of four viewpoints) has their own context, that is, information&#xD;
    important for the perspective and they also have relationships with each other, as shown in the figure below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Perspective&lt;/a>s&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Different people have different backgrounds and ideas that modify their opinions. When attempting to achieve a common&#xD;
    understanding on something as complex as the enterprise IT environment (or a subset of it), including its processes,&#xD;
    structure, and relationships, we need a way to describe architecture and architecturally significant issues in a way&#xD;
    that will be understood by each impacted group. This is done by describing the enterprise at three different, yet&#xD;
    related, &lt;em>&lt;strong>perspectives&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> or &lt;em>&lt;strong>levels&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> as shown below. Each of these&#xD;
    perspectives has a context in terms of inputs or influences (across the top of the figure) and also there are&#xD;
    relationships between them, as described below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Context of each of the Three UAM Perspectives&quot; src=&quot;./resources/UAM_FW_Perspectives.png&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Perspective is a description of the significant aspects of the IT architecture from a business viewpoint.&#xD;
    The Logical Perspective is a description of the IT architecture from a logical perspective showing the applications and&#xD;
    processes that support the business viewpoint, including how the applications are used, where they are logically&#xD;
    deployed and how they interact with each other. Technical Perspective of the IT architecture is a description of the&#xD;
    technical level (specific hardware) components, network, systems, storage systems etc that supports the Logical&#xD;
    viewpoints, and in turn the Business viewpoints.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As illustrated in the figure, the Business Perspective will &lt;em>drive&lt;/em> the structure and definition of the Logical&#xD;
    Perspective, which in turn &lt;em>drives&lt;/em> the definition of the Technical Perspective of the architecture. This does&#xD;
    not imply a hierarchical relationship wherein the Business Perspective prescribes the Logical architecture, and the&#xD;
    Logical architecture prescribes the Technical architecture. Rather, it means that architecture elements (and other&#xD;
    information) are communicated in one direction, and architectural decisions must be made at the appropriate perspective&#xD;
    level within the IT architecture, and these decisions and tradeoffs are reflected back (modify) up to the previous&#xD;
    architectural levels so that the appropriate decision makers and other architects can be made aware of the impact.&#xD;
    Rather, it means that architecture elements (and other information, called &lt;em>drivers&lt;/em>) are communicated in one&#xD;
    direction, and any Architectural Decision (that might be the result of tradeoffs) that affects the resulting&#xD;
    architecture must be communicated to and made at a level within the enterprise (e.g., Business Domain vs. CIO)&#xD;
    appropriate to the scope and impact of the decision. Also, and very important, decisions (tradeoffs) made at say the&#xD;
    Technical level need to be reflected back and modify the Logical Perspective if required—likewise Logical to Business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An architectural goal implies a desired condition, while an architectural constraint implies mandatory compliance;&#xD;
    however, even constraints can be intentionally ignored. For example, a constraint that requires the business to comply&#xD;
    with certain policies might be ignored because the cost of making the changes necessary to comply far exceeds the&#xD;
    penalties incurred by non-compliance. These tradeoffs are communicated back to the Logical and Business Perspectives,&#xD;
    and may require some updates to these perspectives or even executive level approval of trade-off decisions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Architecting is about balancing forces and making tradeoffs to create a solution that optimally satisfies conflicting&#xD;
    requirements. This means that the business model defines models and constraints that describe what it requires from the&#xD;
    logical architecture. The same applies to the logical and the technical architecture. Where conflicts arise, as they&#xD;
    always do, localized sub-optimal solutions must be found in order to ensure an optimum overall solution. When these&#xD;
    decisions have a broad impact (i.e. beyond a local system and IT architecture, they apply to the business line or to&#xD;
    the complete enterprise), they are termed &lt;b>Architectural Decisions&lt;/b> and must be formally agreed to by stakeholders&#xD;
    represented by an architecture board (See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/roadmaps/uam_ad_governance_D3C747FE.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0TknkGjpEeS7ieerwXbTqg&quot;>Roadmap: AD&#xD;
    Governance&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These different perspectives of IT architectures must always be considered when communicating with&#xD;
    stakeholders—discussing only one of them with an individual may convey an incomplete picture. Furthermore, it can cause&#xD;
    that individual to misunderstand the consequences of his or her decisions regarding the tradeoffs and compromises&#xD;
    required in other perspectives. The impact of decisions at one of the perspectives must be translated to the other&#xD;
    ones, and communicated. This helps stakeholders understand the benefits and disadvantages of tradeoffs, which leads to&#xD;
    architectural alignment. Architectural alignment helps us understand the consequences of decisions.&lt;br />&#xD;
