  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the Logical level, locations are logical and therefore there is still a level of abstraction to their definition.&#xD;
    For example, at Point-of-Presence (or ATM) will be defined in detail but not the specifics of their locations&#xD;
    (deployment details). The activities or services provided at each location and the communications (relationships)&#xD;
    between locations are defined in more detail, including non-functional aspects (i.e. bandwidths, volumes, and latency&#xD;
    requirements).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objective is to make this model easily understandable and usable by&amp;nbsp;technical people, but also to ensure that&#xD;
    this level is understood and agreed to by all stakeholders.&#xD;

and stakeholders are key to ensuring that this is the case, but logical level technical details are included.</sectionDescription>

processes and activities are defined. The specifics of how and where activities and services are provided are defined, with&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>Relationships between&amp;nbsp;locations support the business: they support the business processes and the provision of&#xD;
services to employees and customers. These relationships are define in terms of the type of communications and&#xD;
characteristic such as importance (availability, etc.) and volumes. Logical level details are added such as protocols,&#xD;
bandwidths, and allowed latencies.</sectionDescription>

    A hierarchical set of model works very well to capture complex locations. Abstract these complex locations, and&#xD;
