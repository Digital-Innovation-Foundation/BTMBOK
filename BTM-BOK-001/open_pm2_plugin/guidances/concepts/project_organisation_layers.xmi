    &lt;strong>Fig. 1&lt;/strong> Project organisation
&lt;/p>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    Note that there is only one project team, which is composed of the people assuming the roles defined in the Performing,
    Managing and Directing layers. For the project to succeed, these people need to work together as a team.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h5>
    1. Business Governing Layer
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Business Governing Layer determines the vision and strategy for the organisation as a whole. It consists of one or
    more management committees operating at a high or the highest management level. It is here that priorities are defined,
    investment decisions are made, and resources are allocated.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h5>
    2. Steering Layer
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Steering Layer provides general project direction and guidance. It keeps the project focused on its objectives. It
    reports to the Appropriate Governance Body (AGB). The Steering Layer is composed of the roles defined in the Directing
    and Management Layers plus other optional roles.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h5>
    3. Directing Layer
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Directing Layer champions the project and owns its Business Case. It mobilises the necessary resources and monitors
    the project’s performance in order to realise the project’s objectives. The Directing Layer comprises the roles of
    Project Owner (PO) and Solution Provider (SP).
&lt;/p>
&lt;h5>
    4. Managing Layer
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Managing Layer focuses on day-to-day project management. It organises, monitors and controls work to produce the
    intended deliverables and implement them in the business organisation. Members of the Managing Layer report to the
    Directing Layer. The Managing Layer comprises the roles of Business Manager (BM) and Project Manager (PM). It is of
    utmost importance for the success of the project that there is close collaboration and good communication between these
    two roles.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h5>
    5. Performing Layer
&lt;/h5>
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>
    The Performing Layer carries out the project work. It produces the deliverables and implements them in the business
    organisation. Members of the Performing Layer report to the Managing Layer. The Performing Layer comprises the roles of
    the Business Implementation Group (BIG) and the Project Core Team (PCT).&lt;br />
