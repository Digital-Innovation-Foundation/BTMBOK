    EXPLORING MANAGERIAL CAREERS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Elizabeth Charbonnier: ChezPastis.com&lt;br />&#xD;
    ChezPastis.com, the brainchild of Elisabeth Charbonnier, specializes in selling French and other gourmet foods online.&#xD;
    Before starting ChezPastis.com, Elisabeth and her partners were professional chefs, and their goal for their company is&#xD;
    to make gourmet products available to the world. ChezPastis.com began with a bang, and before long Elisabeth and her&#xD;
    partners were too busy to plan for the future and were just trying to survive. After six months, ChezPastis.com&#xD;
    experienced growing pains similar to other Internet start-ups.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the partners, Zack Fortuna, was online one day trying to order some books for his daughter’s birthday. The&#xD;
    message he got after attempting to place his order was frustrating: “Sorry! The items you have requested are currently&#xD;
    on back order and will not be available for two months.” Zack needed the books in two weeks, not two months. He decided&#xD;
    to drive to the bookstore and buy books that were in stock rather than waste time online searching for items that might&#xD;
    not be in stock. Suddenly, Zack realized that ChezPastis.com frequently runs out of items as well and this delays&#xD;
    customer orders. Perhaps ChezPastis.com’s growing pains have something to do with their supply problems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Question: Are ChezPastis.com’s inventory problem attributable to poor planning, poor control, or both? How can&#xD;
    Elisabeth, Zack, and the other partners improve the situation?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    “If you are good enough, it isn’t necessary to set aside time for formal planning. After all, ‘planning time’ takes&#xD;
    away from ‘doing time.’” Managers often make such statements, possibly as a way of rationalizing their lack of a formal&#xD;
    planning program. These claims are simply not valid—planning does influence the effectiveness of the entire&#xD;
    organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some years ago, the Calico Candy Company developed and produced a highly successful saltwater taffy Santa Claus. Buoyed&#xD;
    by this success, the company planned and manufactured a saltwater taffy Easter Bunny and produced the Santa at&#xD;
    Christmas again. This time, however, Calico got stuck with its taffy through faulty planning. Market research clearly&#xD;
    showed that consumer preferences had shifted from taffy to chocolate. Rather than plan its products to meet this new&#xD;
    preference, the company stayed with what had worked in the past and lost a “ton of money.” Yes, planning is important.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Outcome: Zack comes to work the next day excited about his insight. The partners know that inventory has been an&#xD;
    ongoing trouble spot but hadn’t realized the effect it could be having on potential customers who get frustrated with&#xD;
    delayed orders and go elsewhere. After collecting data on customer requests and back orders, the partners discover that&#xD;
    they fill customer orders immediately only 50 percent of the time! Jolted by this thunderbolt, the partners decide to&#xD;
    hold regular strategic planning meetings where they will view the big picture and plan for the future. The first things&#xD;
    they decide to do are install better control systems over their inventory process and collect data on customer online&#xD;
    experiences with ChezPastis.com.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Elisabeth proposes setting a goal of never having to tell a customer that requested items are on back order. Zack&#xD;
    agrees that this is an admirable goal; however, he thinks they should set a daring but reachable goal of immediately&#xD;
    filling customer orders 80 percent of the time. After all, they are a small business in an unpredictable environment,&#xD;
    and they don’t want to frustrate employees with a potentially impossible goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The essence of planning is to see opportunities and threats in the future and, respectively, exploit or combat them as&#xD;
    the case may be. . . . Planning is a philosophy, not so much in the literal sense of that word but as an attitude, a&#xD;
    way of life.1&#xD;
