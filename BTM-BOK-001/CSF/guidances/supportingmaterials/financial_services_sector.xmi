  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    We met with IT security leaders from financial services companies and industry organizations to learn about their&#xD;
    cybersecurity challenges. We have undertaken three of the many potential projects they suggested.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NCCoE cybersecurity experts are addressing these challenges through collaboration with vendors of cybersecurity&#xD;
    technologies. If you would like to collaborate on these projects, propose alternative architectures, or know of other&#xD;
    products that might be applicable to these challenge, please contact us or join our Community of Interest at &lt;a&#xD;
