    Current Status&lt;br />&#xD;
    The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) recently released the final project description 5G&#xD;
    Cybersecurity: Preparing a Secure Evolution to 5G, and is currently seeking industry participants and other interested&#xD;
    collaborators to help us develop an example solution. Please see our Federal Register notice for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Read an overview of the project on our two-page fact sheet.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Summary&lt;br />&#xD;
    As 5G-based networks are deployed in our nation and across the world, this brings great promise of positive changes to&#xD;
    the way humans and machines communicate, operate, and interact in the physical and virtual world. Such changes are&#xD;
    possible because 5G networks support increased cybersecurity protections through the addition of standards-based&#xD;
    features and the deployment of more modern information technologies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NCCoE is initiating this project in collaboration with industry participants to show how the components of 5G&#xD;
    architectures can securely mitigate risks and meet industry sectors’ compliance requirements for several 5G use case&#xD;
    scenarios. 5G standards have been designed to support use case-specific capabilities by way of network deployment&#xD;
    options. The proposed proof-of-concept solution will integrate commercial and open source products that leverage&#xD;
    cybersecurity standards and recommended practices to showcase 5G’s robust security features.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This project will result in a National Institute of Standards and Technology&amp;nbsp; Cybersecurity Practice Guide, a&#xD;
    publicly available description of the practical steps needed to implement a cybersecurity reference design that&#xD;
    addresses this challenge.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
