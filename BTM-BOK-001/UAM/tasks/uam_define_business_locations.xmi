    &lt;span>&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;>This task finds and defines the business locations where the &quot;system&quot; being architected&#xD;
    operates along with relationships between these locations. Also, and very important, is the definition of standard&#xD;
    business vocabulary that is used to describe and discuss the business.&lt;/font>&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;span>&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;>To find locations,&amp;nbsp;look at business&amp;nbsp;workflows and&amp;nbsp;business actors involved.&#xD;
    Stakeholders are a good source for this information.&lt;/font>&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>The locations identified during this task are a preliminary view, but their definition must be precise enough to permit&#xD;
further analysis, and agreed by stakeholders.</keyConsiderations>

    Business Processes may provide useful input for the identifications of business locations. Other sources are as-is&#xD;
    documentation of the enterprise or relevant business domains or systems, as the case may be for the scope in question.&#xD;

    When you feel you have collected enough background information, it is time to describe the locations in detail.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt&quot;>&#xD;
    Start by arranging the locations it in some sort of conceptual framework. For example, for a Bank that provides ATM&#xD;
    services, one conceptual location would be &quot;ATM&quot; ... define &lt;i>one&lt;/i> for each type of location not one for each&#xD;
    physical instantiation. Examine the need for security domains, which may be viewed as &quot;locations&quot;, for example a&#xD;
    business's Internet presence may be viewed as a conceptual location accessible to all (including employees), whereas&#xD;
    the businesses Intranet will only be accessible by employees.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt&quot;>&#xD;
    Using the Business Process Model, or other sources of information, determine the services and facilities required at&#xD;
    and between the locations. These are business level services or facilities, such as &quot;access to products and services&quot;&#xD;
    or infrastructure services such as &quot;email&quot; and &quot;telephone&quot;. The objective is to understand what services are provided&#xD;
    at and&amp;nbsp;between locations, which will influence design choices later on.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;span>A Business Locations Model is complete only when it describes every location that the &quot;system&quot; has a presence at&#xD;
