    Current Status&lt;br />&#xD;
    We are currently reviewing comments submitted for draft NISTIR 8269, A Taxonomy and Terminology of Adversarial Machine&#xD;
    Learning. If you have questions, please email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ai-nccoe@nist.gov&quot;>ai-nccoe@nist.gov&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Summary&lt;br />&#xD;
    Machine Learning (ML) is a field within Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on the ability of computers to learn&#xD;
    on their own without being programmed. When these systems are misled or given malicious inputs, Adversarial Machine&#xD;
    Learning (AML) has likely been employed. AML is conducted by malicious actors to undermine the capabilities of ML;&#xD;
    whereas, ML security focuses on understanding these attack consequences with the intention to mitigate the effects of&#xD;
    malicious actors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NISTIR 8269, A Taxonomy and Terminology of Adversarial Machine Learning was developed as a step toward securing&#xD;
    applications of AI, specifically AML, and features a taxonomy of concepts and terminologies. This NISTIR can inform&#xD;
    future standards and best practices for assessing and managing ML security by establishing a common language and&#xD;
    understanding of the rapidly developing AML landscape.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
