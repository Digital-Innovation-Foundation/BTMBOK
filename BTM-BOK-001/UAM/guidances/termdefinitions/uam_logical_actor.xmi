  <mainDescription>Logical Actor represents the types of interactions with the system. An actor may assume one or more roles, and can be&#xD;
equated to the external people or systems that interact with the system under study. Note that Actors are not individuals&#xD;
nor are they necessarily equivalent to job titles; instead, they describe the behavior in the enterprise and the&#xD;
responsibilities of the associated “user”.&amp;nbsp; An understanding and definition of required job titles and an associated&#xD;
organizational structure (likely defined at the Technical level), however, can assist in ensuring that the clustering of&#xD;
Roles into Actors (i.e. User groups) defines a reasonable clustering of skills and a manageable and effective organization.&#xD;
An employee of the enterprise is typically multiple Actors (e.g. employee, manager, analyst, etc.) and therefore has many&#xD;
different Roles (e.g. employee-HR, budgeter, manager-HR, expense claimer, etc.). Likewise a customer is an actor that&#xD;
assumes various roles in relation to the enterprise.&lt;br />&#xD;
