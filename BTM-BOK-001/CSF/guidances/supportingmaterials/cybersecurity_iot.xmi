    DESCRIPTION&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST’s Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT) program supports the development and application of standards,&#xD;
    guidelines, and related tools to improve the cybersecurity of connected devices and the environments in which they are&#xD;
    deployed. By collaborating with stakeholders across government, industry, international bodies, and academia, the&#xD;
    program aims to cultivate trust and foster an environment that enables innovation on a global scale.&#xD;

    Published! Federal Profile of NISTIR 8259A (“Federal Profile”) (June 30, 2020) [FAQs]&lt;br />&#xD;
    NIST is developing a federal profile of the Core Baseline established in NISTIR 8259A (“Federal Profile”) and seeks&#xD;
    feedback from all stakeholders on this initial catalog of proposed IoT device cybersecurity capabilities and related&#xD;
    non-technical capabilities.&amp;nbsp; Also, the IoT for Cybersecurity Program has instituted a new way to provide feedback&#xD;
    and influence the discussion!&lt;br />&#xD;
    NISTIR 8259 and NISTIR 8259A promise to have a lasting impact on IoT device cybersecurity. In a June 1, 2020 blog, NIST&#xD;
    IoT Cybersecurity Program Manager Katerina Megas explains what they mean for manufacturers and consumers—both in the&#xD;
    United States and beyond.&lt;br />&#xD;

    The Final Public Draft of NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5: Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and&#xD;
    Organizations was released on March 16. NIST SP 800-53 presents a proactive and systemic approach to developing&#xD;
    comprehensive safeguarding measures for all types of computing platforms, including general purpose computing systems,&#xD;
    cyber-physical systems, cloud and mobile systems, industrial/process control systems, and Internet of Things (IoT)&#xD;
    devices. NIST seeks comment on this draft through May 15, 2020.&#xD;

    EVENTS&lt;br />&#xD;
    Recent Past Events&lt;br />&#xD;
    July 22 and 23, 2020 | Building the Federal Profile for IoT Device Cybersecurity: Next Steps for Securing Federal&#xD;
    Systems&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    NIST leveraged the Core Baseline established in NISTIR 8259A and analyzed the controls found in NIST SP 800-53 to&#xD;
    develop a catalog of key IoT device cybersecurity capabilities and supporting non-technical manufacturer capabilities&#xD;
    and associated IoT device customer controls. This catalog is a critical building block for establishing a federal&#xD;
    profile of the Core Baseline (“Federal Profile”) to help government entities securely incorporate IoT devices into&#xD;
    their systems and meet security requirements for federal information and systems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The future Federal Profile aims to help manufacturers looking at federal customers and use cases go beyond identifying&#xD;
    the types of cybersecurity capabilities listed in NISTIR 8259A to considering additionally needed technical and&#xD;
    non-technical cybersecurity capabilities. Manufacturers can engineer the technical capabilities and provide&#xD;
    non-technical capabilities to IoT device customers to help ensure that customers’ systems meet an established level of&#xD;
    management, operational, and technical security control requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The virtual workshop will consist of two sessions, one per day and each lasting two hours. It will include panel&#xD;
    discussions on key topics related to cybersecurity challenges for Federal IoT devices. These topics include the need&#xD;
    for support for IoT device cybersecurity capabilities; additional supporting capabilities from the manufacturers and&#xD;
    mechanisms giving agencies confidence that IoT Devices will meet Federal cybersecurity needs.&lt;br />&#xD;
    On May 29, 2020 the NIST Cybersecurity for IoT Program released final NISTIRs 8259 and 8259A, representing a major&#xD;
    milestone in IoT cybersecurity. The publications present six foundational activities and a core baseline of IoT device&#xD;
    cybersecurity capabilities for manufacturers as a starting point towards building more securable devices.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
    The event will feature presentations from Program Manager Kat Megas (see June 1, 2020 blog) and Michael Fagan, followed&#xD;
    by audience Q&amp;amp;A. IoT device manufacturers and all users of industrial and/or home IoT devices are encouraged to&#xD;
    attend.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Workshop on Core IOT Cybersecurity Baseline&lt;br />&#xD;
    August 13, 2019 | Replay Webcast and View Presentations&lt;br />&#xD;
    This Workshop will gather feedback on NIST’s approach to the IoT Cybersecurity Baseline as well as discuss current&#xD;
    status and future directions of this work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    CYBERSECURITY CONSIDERATION IN IOT&lt;br />&#xD;
    The rapid proliferation of internet-connected devices and rise of the IoT come with great anticipation. These newly&#xD;
    connected devices bring the promise of enhanced business efficiencies and increased customer satisfaction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    IoT devices could include wearable fitness trackers, “smart” televisions, wireless infusion pumps, and cars—among many&#xD;
    others. Internet-connected devices generally sense, collect, process, and transmit a wide array of data, ranging from&#xD;
    consumer personally identifiable information to proprietary company data to infrastructure data used to make critical&#xD;
    real-time decisions or to effect a change in the physical world.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Just as there are a variety of new uses, the IoT ecosystem’s nature brings new security considerations. These&#xD;
    considerations include—but are not limited to—constrained power and processing; the ability to manage, update, and&#xD;
    patch devices at scale; and a diverse set of new applications across consumer and industrial sectors.&#xD;
