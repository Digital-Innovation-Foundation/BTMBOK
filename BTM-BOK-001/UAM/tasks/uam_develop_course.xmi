  <mainDescription>After defining the objectives for the training course (i.e.&amp;nbsp;the audience, focus and scope) the next step is to list&#xD;
the detailed skills and knowledge that are to be taught. These are then organized into a logical sequence of modules after&#xD;
which the detail for each part of the course is flushed out. Examples and exercises may also be included within the course&#xD;
material, as provided by the source material and domain experts.</mainDescription>

  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Training is an important part of implementing a system and keeping it running. IT architecture definitions are an&#xD;
    excellent source of information for developing the required training, be it at the user level or even for developers&#xD;
    and maintainers. This task develops the required training based upon the objectives defined for the course.&#xD;
