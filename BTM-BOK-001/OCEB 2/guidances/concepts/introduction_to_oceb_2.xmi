    Object Management Group (OMG&amp;reg;) is an international, open membership, not-for-profit computer industry standards&#xD;
    consortium. OMG Task Forces develop modeling and integration standards for a wide range of technologies and an even&#xD;
    wider range of industries. OMG's Model Driven Architecture&amp;reg; (MDA&amp;reg;) supports the complete application lifecycle from&#xD;
    design, through development and deployment, to maintenance and evolution. Modeling standards including the Unified&#xD;
    Modeling Language&amp;trade; (UML&amp;reg;),&amp;nbsp; Business Process Modeling and Notation&amp;trade; (BPMN&amp;trade;), and the Systems Modeling Language&#xD;
    (OMG SysML&amp;trade;), enable powerful visual design for software structure and behavior, processes in software and business,&#xD;
    and virtually every type of system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            OMG owns Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN)&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            The OCEB 2 examinations were written by the same people who wrote the BPMN specification.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            The OCEB 2 examinations cover much more than BPMN&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Credentials are important in the BPM world, where practitioners may work on many projects for different clients or&#xD;
    employees over time. Holders of OMGâ€™s OCEB 2 certifications benefit by gaining recognition for their knowledge and&#xD;
    skills, and their demonstrated commitment to their profession. Your OCEB 2 certification can open the door to job&#xD;
    advancement and promotion at your current company, or help with new career opportunities outside. For the employer,&#xD;
    certification helps evaluate both current staff and potential new hires, analyze performance, and motivate team members&#xD;
    to enhance their knowledge and skills.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    Your status as an OCEB 2 Certified Professional shows that you have studied the knowledge and skills required to make&#xD;
    you a more attractive candidate for hiring and promotion.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Who is behind the OCEB 2 Certification?&lt;/strong>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The OCEB Program was developed and is run as a joint program of OMG and the UML Technology Institute Co., Ltd.(UTI).&#xD;
    The OCEB examinations are offered worldwide in English at Pearson VUE testing centers in a program administered by OMG;&#xD;
    the examinations are also available in the Japanese language in Asia in a program administered by UTI. OCEB is one of&#xD;
    four Certification Program jointly produced by OMG and UTI; the others are OCUP&amp;trade; for UML, OCRES&amp;trade; for Real-time and&#xD;
    Embedded and OCSMP&amp;trade; for System Modelers. Examinations are administered for OMG by Pearson VUE at their world-wide&#xD;
    network of secure testing centers.&lt;br />&#xD;
