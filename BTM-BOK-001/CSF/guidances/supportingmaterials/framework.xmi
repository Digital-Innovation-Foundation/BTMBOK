    Areas for Development&lt;br />&#xD;
    The following list of high-priority areas is not intended to be exhaustive. These are important areas identified by&#xD;
    stakeholders that should inform future versions of the Framework. They require continued focus; they are important but&#xD;
    evolving areas that have yet to be developed or need further research and understanding. While tools, methodologies,&#xD;
    and standards exist for some of the areas, they need to become more mature, available, and widely adopted. To be&#xD;
    effective in addressing these areas, NIST will work with stakeholders to identify primary challenges, solicit input to&#xD;
    address those identified needs, and collaboratively develop and execute action plans for addressing them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Authentication&lt;br />&#xD;
    While new authentication solutions continue to emerge, there is only a partial framework of standards to promote&#xD;
    security and interoperability. The usability of authentication approaches remains a significant challenge for many&#xD;
    control systems, as many existing authentication tools are for standard computing platforms. Moreover, many solutions&#xD;
    are geared only toward identification of individuals; there are fewer standards-based approaches for automated device&#xD;
    authentication.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Automated Indicator Sharing&lt;br />&#xD;
    The automated sharing of indicator information can provide organizations with timely, actionable information that they&#xD;
    can use to detect and respond to cybersecurity events as they are occurring. Sharing indicators based on information&#xD;
    that is discovered prior to and during incident response activities enables other organizations to deploy measures to&#xD;
    detect, mitigate, and possibly prevent attacks as they occur.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Conformity Assessment&lt;br />&#xD;
    Conformity assessment can be used to show that a product, service, or system meets specified requirements for managing&#xD;
    cybersecurity risk. The output of conformity assessment activities can be used to enhance an organization’s&#xD;
    understanding of its implementation of a Framework profile. Successful conformity assessment provides the needed level&#xD;
    of confidence, is efficient, and has a sustainable and scalable business case. Critical infrastructure’s evolving&#xD;
    implementation of Framework profiles should drive the identification of private sector conformity assessment activities&#xD;
    that address the confidence and information needs of stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Cybersecurity Workforce&lt;br />&#xD;
    A skilled cybersecurity workforce is needed to meet the unique cybersecurity needs of critical infrastructure. There is&#xD;
    a well-documented shortage of general cybersecurity experts; however, there is a greater shortage of qualified&#xD;
    cybersecurity experts who also have an understanding of the unique challenges posed to particular parts of critical&#xD;
    infrastructure. As the cybersecurity threat and technology environment evolves, the cybersecurity workforce must&#xD;
    continue to adapt to design, develop, implement, maintain and continuously improve the necessary cybersecurity&#xD;
    practices within critical infrastructure environments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Data Analytics&lt;br />&#xD;
    Several significant challenges must be overcome for the extraordinary potential of analytics to be realized, including&#xD;
    the lack of: taxonomies of big data; mathematical and measurement foundations; analytic tools; measurement of integrity&#xD;
    of tools; and correlation and causation. More importantly, the privacy implications in the use of these analytic tools&#xD;
    must be addressed for legal and public confidence reasons.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Federal Agency Cybersecurity Alignment&lt;br />&#xD;
    It is important that any effort to apply the Cybersecurity Framework across the Federal government complement and&#xD;
    enhance rather than duplicate or conflict with existing statute, executive direction, policy, and standards. It should&#xD;
    also seek to minimize the burden placed upon implementing departments and agencies by building from existing evaluation&#xD;
    and reporting regimes, and encourage common and comparable evaluation of cybersecurity posture across federal&#xD;
    departments and agencies, given diverse requirements and risk environments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    International Aspects, Impacts, and Alignment&lt;br />&#xD;
    Globalization and advances in technology have driven unprecedented increases in innovation, competitiveness, and&#xD;
    economic growth. Critical infrastructure has become dependent on these enabling technologies for increased efficiency&#xD;
    and new capabilities. Many governments are proposing and enacting strategies, policies, laws, and regulations covering&#xD;
    information technology for critical infrastructure as a result. Because many organizations and most sectors operate&#xD;
    globally or rely on the interconnectedness of the global digital infrastructure, these requirements are affecting, or&#xD;
    may affect, how organizations operate, conduct business, and develop new products and services.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Supply Chain Risk Management&lt;br />&#xD;
    Supply chains consist of organizations that design, produce, source, and deliver products and services. All&#xD;
    organizations are part of, and dependent upon, product and service supply chains. Supply chain risk is an essential&#xD;
    part of the risk landscape that should be included in organizational risk management programs. Although many&#xD;
    organizations have robust internal risk management processes, supply chain criticality and dependency analysis,&#xD;
    collaboration, information sharing, and trust mechanisms remain a challenge. Organizations can struggle to identify&#xD;
    their risks and prioritize their actions—leaving the weakest links susceptible to penetration and disruption. Supply&#xD;
    chain risk management, especially product and service integrity, is an emerging discipline characterized by diverse&#xD;
    perspectives, disparate bodies of knowledge, and fragmented standards and best practices.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Technical Privacy Standards&lt;br />&#xD;
    A key challenge for privacy has been the difficulty in reaching consensus on definition and scope management, given its&#xD;
    nature of being context-dependent and relatively subjective. The lack of risk management model, standards, and&#xD;
    supporting privacy metrics, makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of an organization’s privacy protection&#xD;
    methods. Furthermore, organizational policies are often designed to address business risks that arise out of privacy&#xD;
    violations, such as reputation or liability risks, rather than focusing on minimizing the risk of harm at an individual&#xD;
    or societal level. Although research is being conducted in the public and private sectors to improve current privacy&#xD;
    practices, many gaps remain. In particular, there are few identifiable technical standards or best practices to&#xD;
    mitigate the impact of cybersecurity activities on individuals’ privacy or civil liberties.&#xD;
