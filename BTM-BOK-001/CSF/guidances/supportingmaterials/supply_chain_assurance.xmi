    Current Status&lt;br />&#xD;
    The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) recently released the final project description: Validating the&#xD;
    Integrity of Computing Devices.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This project is currently seeking technology vendors to participate in the development of an example solution. Please&#xD;
    see our Federal Register notice for more information. If you as a technology vendor are interested in providing&#xD;
    products and technical expertise as a collaborator on the reference design for this project, please send an email to &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;mailto:supplychain-nccoe@nist.gov&quot;>supplychain-nccoe@nist.gov&lt;/a> requesting a Letter of Interest template.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Summary&lt;br />&#xD;
    Organizations today face the challenge of identifying trustworthy products due to increased risk resulting from&#xD;
    compromises in cyber supply chains.&amp;nbsp; Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management is an evolving approach to modernizing&#xD;
    information technology (IT) systems, as information and operational technologies rely on complex, globally distributed&#xD;
    and interconnected, supply chain ecosystems to provide highly refined, cost-effective, and reusable solutions.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For this project, the NCCoE will produce example implementations to demonstrate how organizations can verify that the&#xD;
    internal components of their purchased computing devices are genuine and have not been altered during the manufacturing&#xD;
    and distribution processes.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, this project will demonstrate how to inspect the processes that verify&#xD;
    that the components in a computing device match the attributes and measurements declared by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This project will result in a publicly available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide, a detailed implementation guide of&#xD;
    the practical steps needed to implement a cybersecurity reference architecture model that addresses the challenge.&#xD;
