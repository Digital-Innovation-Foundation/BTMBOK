  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the Business level, locations are conceptual and therefore this makes it easier to capture and define them. For&#xD;
    example, locations involved in a Bank could be reduced to: Headquarters, Branch and Point-of-Presence (or ATM).&#xD;
    Conceptual types of locations are defined, the activities or services provided at each location and the communications&#xD;
    (relationships) between locations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objective is to make this model easily consumable by business people, with the goal to ensuring that this level is&#xD;
    understood and agreed to by all stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Relationships between&amp;nbsp;locations support the business: they support the business processes and the provision of&#xD;

    A hierarchical set of model works very well to capture complex locations. Abstract these complex locations, and&#xD;
