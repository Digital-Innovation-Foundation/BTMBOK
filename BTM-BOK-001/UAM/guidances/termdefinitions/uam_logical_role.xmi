  <mainDescription>A Logical Role represents the interfaces that interact with the activities and processes of the system, and may be internal&#xD;
or external. They are equated to or defined by the activities (and by extension the responsibilities) that it interacts&#xD;
with in the system. At the logical level all of the analysis was done and all actors and roles and their structure and&#xD;
relationships are defined. However organizational positions have not necessarily been equated to actors and roles, and the&#xD;
complete picture of the required interface, including security aspects (RBAC) has not been defined. &lt;br />&#xD;
