    Summary&lt;br />&#xD;
    In 2005, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentialing focused on authentication through traditional computing&#xD;
    devices, such as desktops and laptops, where a PIV card would provide a common authentication through integrated smart&#xD;
    card readers. Today, the proliferation of mobile devices that do not have integrated smart card readers complicates PIV&#xD;
    credentials and authentication.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials helps organizations authenticate individuals who use mobile&#xD;
    devices and need secure access to information systems and applications.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project demonstrates a feasible security platform based on federal PIV standards that leverages identity proofing&#xD;
    and vetting results of current and valid PIV credentials to enable two-factor authentication to information technology&#xD;
    systems via mobile devices while meeting policy guidelines. Although the PIV program and the NCCoE Derived PIV&#xD;
    Credentials project are primarily aimed at the federal sector’s needs, both are relevant to mobile device users in the&#xD;
    commercial sector using smart card-based credentials or other means of authenticating identity and supports operations&#xD;
    in federal (PIV), non-federal critical infrastructure (PIV-interoperable or PIV-I), and general business&#xD;
    (PIV-compatible or PIV-C) environments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NCCoE reference design includes the following capabilities:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    authenticate users of mobile devices using secure cryptographic authentication exchanges&lt;br />&#xD;
    provide a feasible security platform based on Federal Digital Identity Guidelines&lt;br />&#xD;
    utilize a public key infrastructure (PKI) with credentials derived from a PIV card&lt;br />&#xD;
    support operations in a PIV, PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I), and PIV-Compatible (PIV-C) environments&lt;br />&#xD;
    Issue PKI-based derived PIV credentials at authenticator assurance level (AAL) 2&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    provide logical access to remote resources hosted either in a data center or the cloud&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Collaborating Vendors&lt;br />&#xD;
    Organizations participating in this project submitted their capabilities in response to an open call in the Federal&#xD;
    Register for all sources of relevant security capabilities from academia and industry (vendors and integrators). The&#xD;
    following respondents with relevant capabilities or product components (identified as “Technology&#xD;
    Partners/Collaborators” herein) signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to collaborate with NIST in a&#xD;
    consortium to build this example solution.&#xD;
