    Current Status&lt;br />&#xD;
    The public comment period has closed on the draft project description, Implementing a Zero Trust Architecture. Thank&#xD;
    you to everyone who shared their feedback with us. We are currently reviewing the comments received, and will share&#xD;
    information about next steps for this project soon.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    Summary&lt;br />&#xD;
    The proliferation of cloud computing, mobile device use, and the Internet of Things has dissolved&amp;nbsp; traditional&#xD;
    network boundaries. Hardened network perimeters alone are no longer effective for providing enterprise security in a&#xD;
    world of increasingly sophisticated threats. Zero trust is a design approach to architecting an information technology&#xD;
    environment that could reduce an organization’s risk exposure in a “perimeter-less” world.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A zero trust architecture treats all users as potential threats and prevents access to data and resources until the&#xD;
    users can be properly authenticated and their access authorized. In essence, a zero trust architecture allows a user&#xD;
    full access but only to the bare minimum they need to perform their job. If a device is compromised, zero trust can&#xD;
    ensure that the damage is contained.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The concept of zero trust has been around for more than a decade, but technology to support it is now moving into the&#xD;
    mainstream. A zero trust architecture leans heavily on components and capabilities for identity management, asset&#xD;
    management, application authentication, network segmentation, and threat intelligence. Architecting for zero trust&#xD;
    should enhance cybersecurity without sacrificing the user experience. The NCCoE is researching ongoing industry&#xD;
    developments in zero trust and its component technologies that support the goals and objectives of a practical, secure,&#xD;
    and standards-based zero trust architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Federal CIO Council Efforts&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Since late 2018, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and NCCoE cybersecurity researchers have had the&#xD;
    opportunity to work closely with the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council, federal agencies, and industry to&#xD;
    address the challenges and opportunities for implementing zero trust architectures across U.S. government networks.&#xD;
    This work resulted in publication of draft NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In November 2019, the NCCoE and the Federal CIO Council cohosted a Zero Trust Architecture Technical Exchange Meeting&#xD;
    that brought together zero trust vendors and practitioners from government and industry to share successes, best&#xD;
    practices, and lessons learned in implementing zero trust in the federal government and the commercial sector.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An NCCoE project will build on this body of knowledge as we seek to build out and document an example zero trust&#xD;
    architecture that aligns to the concepts and principles in NIST SP 800-207 and that uses commercially available&#xD;
    products.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
