    A Migration Plan is a complex document since it defines how the enterprise should migrate from the current situation,&#xD;
    the current state, to a future state as defined by the IT architecture. It is complex since there are typically many&#xD;
    dependencies between system components, and one cannot shut down the system or enterprise during the migration!&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are usually two aspects to a migration plan: &lt;strong>operational&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>technical&lt;/strong>.&#xD;
    Architects must work in conjunction with business analysts to devise a feasible and manageable migration approach. For&#xD;
    example, there may be technical advantages to migrating clients over to a new system over an extended period of time,&#xD;
    but it may not be achievable due to operational and business rule constraints. Many details have to be sorted out as&#xD;
    part of migration planning: when to convert existing data holdings from various sources, when to train staff, which&#xD;
    staff will transition to which new roles, staffing levels required, interim operational procedures required during the&#xD;
    transition, how and when to transition clients, new installs required and how they will be delivered—the release&#xD;
    planning&amp;nbsp;and project planning part of migration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To start the definition of the migration plan you must first identify the system components that change or are somehow&#xD;
    affected while moving to the future state. This step is essentially a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../UAM/tasks/uam_gap_analysis_37973A91.html&quot; guid=&quot;_PogDkNKaEdyTfZVjf0InKw&quot;>Target vs. Existing Gap&#xD;
    Analysis&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;where changes needed to system components are identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Now the difficult portion&amp;nbsp;begins, the definition of the migration plan based upon, in part, the following factors:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cost and benefits of migrating each specific component;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Required sequencing of implementations (e.g. New database needed prior to a process&amp;nbsp;automation);&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business priorities, usually driven by a large benefit, but no necessarily;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical priorities (e.g. the failure or imminent failure of hardware or software);&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Resource considerations;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Complexity defined by the number of dependencies or the technology.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Choosing an evolutionary path for adapting the business to a new architecture having new processes and technologies can&#xD;
    be a major challenge, especially for large complex operations. Always look for the changes that can deliver the biggest&#xD;
    gains for the dollars spent first. From then on, it becomes a question not only of priorities but of feasibility. The&#xD;
    path to the end state must be achievable in a cost effective way and be operationally viable. Make Architectural&#xD;
    Decisions that will fit into the bigger picture but carefully assess investments for which benefits might not be gained&#xD;
    for quite some time into the future. Make architectural decisions that can adapt and prepare for change based on the&#xD;
    need for change in the business domain. Know where you are going, ensure you can always get there, architect for&#xD;
    change, and manage premature investments based on the need for future change.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is value in having a mathematical representation of the business so that cost effectiveness of evolutionary&#xD;
    options can be examined. The mathematical model should represent demand (input volumes), throughput, staffing, and&#xD;
    processing times. Keep in mind that mathematical models and simulation models are only as good as the data analysis&#xD;
    underlying their assumptions (i.e., GIGO: Garbage-In, Garbage-Out). Also mathematical models, and especially simulation&#xD;
    models, are expensive to build and should only be considered for larger more complex operations. Some of the techniques&#xD;
    for obtaining valid measurements include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Gathering and plotting historical input volumetrics to understand trends for future projections.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyzing future input volume through client research and interviews.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Gathering historical data on the time it takes to perform certain tasks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Conducting timing studies to obtain data on the time it takes to perform new tasks or existing tasks that are&#xD;
        altered in some way. If task steps are timed individually and only certain steps are being eliminated then the&#xD;
        analyst can determine the projected time to perform the altered task. However, if the step time is too minute then&#xD;
        the revised task must be represented in some way to obtain an accurate measurement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prototypes can be an effective way of obtaining timing data. However, if the task is completely new, do not&#xD;
        underestimate the effect of user practice. A fully trained and experienced user will be able to perform a task&#xD;
        significantly faster than someone who has never done the task before.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Input data quality can also have an effect on processing times and this should be examined also where applicable.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyzing arrival patterns to better understand the peak loads that can affect system sizing and staffing.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Often the mathematical models themselves and the process of devising them can help to identify potential improvements&#xD;
    to the business processes. All knowledge gained about the business can assist in making better evolutionary and&#xD;
    Architectural Decisions. Intuition can be deceiving. When the numbers are worked out, what you thought could deliver&#xD;
    great gains might not.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architecture models, particularly those at the Business level and Logical level, are also excellent tools for&#xD;
    assessing the impact and feasibility of evolutionary options and can highlight the throwaway or transitional&#xD;
    requirements—typically these are tasks or steps within a task.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are only a few of the aspects to consider when defining a migration plan ... whole books have been written on&#xD;
    this subject, and should be consulted!&lt;br />&#xD;
