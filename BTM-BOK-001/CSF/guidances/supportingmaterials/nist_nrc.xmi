  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The NIST NRC Postdoctoral Program supports a nationwide competitive postdoctoral program administered in cooperation&#xD;
    with the National Academies/National Research Council (NRC). The postdoctoral program brings research scientists and&#xD;
    engineers of unusual promise and ability to perform advanced research related to the NIST mission, introduces the&#xD;
    latest university research results and techniques to NIST scientific programs, strengthens mutual communication with&#xD;
    university researchers, shares NIST unique research facilities with the U.S. scientific and engineering communities,&#xD;
    and provides a valuable mechanism for the transfer of research results from NIST to the scientific and engineering&#xD;
    communities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Detailed information on procedures and all necessary application materials and supporting documents are available from&#xD;
    the NRC Research Associateship Program which also includes NIST-specific information on the program.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For the most current list of opportunities, please refer to the NRC website page for the NIST NRC Postdoctoral Research&#xD;
    program.&#xD;
