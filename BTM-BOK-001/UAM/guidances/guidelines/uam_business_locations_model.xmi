    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/concepts/uam_it_architecture_193573CD.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_XTWLgN_kEdynr9jlfK-aMA&quot;>Concept: IT Architecture&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;find the idea of &lt;em>viewpoints (views&lt;/em>&#xD;
    and &lt;em>aspects)&lt;/em> from which a system can be modeled. Location is one of the aspects, or vertical slices through&#xD;
    the system, that defines and models a perspective that is useful in understanding the system and its operation. In the&#xD;
    Unified Architecture Method (UAM), the purpose of&amp;nbsp;a Location Model&amp;nbsp;is to capture the decomposition of the&#xD;
    system into locations that host business activities. This is done at several levels of abstraction, namely Business&#xD;
    Location (the most abstract), Logical Location, and Technical Location (the least abstract, at which actual enterprise&#xD;
    technical standards for hardware and software are described). The following is an introduction to the Business&#xD;
    Locations (conceptual) level model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the &lt;em>business&lt;/em> level described here, the notion of location is used to identify and describe the classes of&#xD;
    location at which the system has a presence. The Business Locations Model supports this viewpoint by describing what&#xD;
    business activities are carried on at the defined locations, and organizes them into a simple model. See: &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../UAM/guidances/guidelines/uam_business_locations_model_BF632121.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_LEYwkOSgEdyYxtlRIMoTnw&quot;>Guideline: Business Locations Model&lt;/a>. The locations model works best if layering is&#xD;
    used to deal with complexity and to provide views appropriate for the audience and objectives; and comprehension is&#xD;
    greatly improved. Detail is hidden, while allowing for it to be defined in lower layers, as required to meet the&#xD;
    objectives of the architecture effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong>&lt;u>Note&lt;/u>:&lt;/strong> Since UAM may model the complete enterprise (or business domain), the level of&#xD;
        detail to be included in this model is a judgment call of the architect, based upon:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN-LEFT: 2em&quot;>&#xD;

            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                The size of the enterprise or (business line)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Time and resource constraints&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>location&lt;/b> represents the initial, abstract, somewhat &lt;i>physical&lt;/i> partitioning and distribution of the&#xD;
    enterprise, and is concerned with the geographic placement of (conceptual level) system resources (buildings,&#xD;
    points-of-presence, and other notions) along with the business activities provided there. A locality expresses&#xD;
    notionally where business process are supported, thus there is a strong connection between &lt;em>business location&lt;/em>&#xD;
    and &lt;em>business activity&lt;/em>.&amp;nbsp;The semantics of locality implies a tighter grouping of&amp;nbsp;activities without&#xD;
    defining exact geographic locations, or how the activity is to be supported. It is conceivable for very complex, very&#xD;
    large enterprises, that there might&amp;nbsp;be locations that decompose to finer-grained localities (just as a system&#xD;
    might contain subsystems). The description of a location includes a general indication of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>type&lt;/i>&#xD;
    of&amp;nbsp;location being defined (e.g. Headquarters, factory, point-of-presence, etc.) along with the business activities&#xD;
    supported&amp;nbsp;at the location.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Locations Model is also used to illustrate the conceptual level connections between the locations. Based&#xD;
    on the business activities to be supported at the locations, collaborations of localities can be constructed&amp;nbsp;to&#xD;
    help characterize the connections between the localities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Location Model diagrams show how business processes are distributed across the locations, and how they are&#xD;
    connected. In the lower level &lt;em>Logical&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Technical&lt;/em> &lt;em>Perspectives&lt;/em>, developed based upon this&#xD;
    business level view, the location of computing resources is defined, and is important when considering functional and&#xD;
    non-functional requirements. For many systems engineers, this is &quot;the architecture&quot;, the Logical and Technical&#xD;
    level&amp;nbsp;views.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Locations Model consists of two elements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Location&lt;/strong> - a location is a collection&amp;nbsp;of system activities&amp;nbsp;(processes and&#xD;
        tasks)&amp;nbsp;that provide services at that location.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Connections&lt;/strong> - pathways (for information, mass, energy, or discrete physical items) supporting the&#xD;
        required process interactions between locations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The semantics of the location diagrams are similar to those of UML deployment diagrams, with locations represented as&#xD;
    stereotyped UML nodes. In the UML standard, a node is a classifier that &quot;... is a physical object that represents a&#xD;
    processing resource, generally, having at least a memory and often processing capability as well. Nodes include&#xD;
    computing devices but also human resources or mechanical processing resources.&quot; Therefore, UML allows us to extend the&#xD;
    semantics of nodes, and the associations that connect them, through stereotyping and the application of tagged values.&#xD;
    This is used to define locations and connections. The icon for a&amp;nbsp;Business Location&amp;nbsp;is a building (see the&#xD;
    illustration below).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Locations are characterized with:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Activities&lt;/strong> - a list of the business activities provides at the location, which relates&#xD;
        directly to the Business Process Model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business level non-functional requirements&lt;/strong> - things such as importance, survivability and&#xD;
        availability requirements of the location.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Connections are characterized by the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Activities&lt;/strong> - the business activities that traverse the link.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business level non-functional requirements&lt;/strong> - things such as volumes, importance, survivability and&#xD;
        availability requirements of the communications path.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you move to the Logical and Technical Locations Models, computing concepts are added to the locations model,&#xD;
    becoming more like traditional IP network models.&amp;nbsp;Business Location may also be refined into more than one Logical&#xD;
    or Technical level location, as dictated by the requirements of the business. And&amp;nbsp;location models&amp;nbsp;can&#xD;
    represent quite disparate things, ultimately realized, for example, as a collection of hardware platforms (e.g. network&#xD;
    routers etc.), part of a computational resource (e.g. ATM, servers and storage), or groups of collaborating human&#xD;
    resources (e.g. call-center).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    ATMs, a Data Center, and Bank Branches. See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
